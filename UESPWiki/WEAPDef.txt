== Notes ==
* Currently, the only known place to find out the weapon type is from the keywords associated with the weapon, which will contain keywords such as "WeapTypeBattleaxe", "WeapTypeDagger", and "WeapTypeStaff".
* Cases have been found where the weapon type from the keyword disagrees with the ETYP information. Specifically, the [[Skyrim:Headsman's Axe|Headsman's Axe]] is identified by the keyword "WeapTypeWarAxe" as being a war axe, which is a one-handed weapon.  However, its ETYP is "BothHands".  This appears to mean that the weapon uses two hands when equipped, but that its damage rating and perks are influenced by the one-handed skill.
:''Check ebony blade to see if it matches this behavior?''
* Keywords can also specify the weapon material (e.g., "WeapMaterialIron") and whether the weapon is sold by merchants ("VendorItemWeapon")

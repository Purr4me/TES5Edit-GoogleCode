# MWRandItem Effect Data File - June 2003
#		Dave Humphrey, uesp@sympatico.ca 
#
# This file contains the external levelled lists that will be used in the output 
# scripts to help add the random items to the game. For each levelled list that
# you produce with MWRandItem with script output enabled, two scripts will be
# created. One installation script that uses the AddToLevItem function and one
# removal script that uses the RemoveFromLevItem function. Both functions require
# the player to have Tribunal or Bloodmoon installed. The scripts are meant to
# be called once as global scripts and will stop themselves automatically.
#
# For each levelled list in this file, a single AddToLevItem/RemoveFromLevItem
# call will be made for each level list made in the program
#
# Each external levelled list is contained on one line with the format:
#
#	List = "ListName" [, Number]
#
#		"ListName" = The external levelled list name. Quotations are optional.
#				     Name is limited to 32 bytes in length.
#		Number	   = Number of times to add the new list to the given list. If
#					 the number is not specified, 1 is the default.
#
# Anything after the '#' character on a line is ignore.

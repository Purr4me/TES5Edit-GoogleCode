[size="4"][color="#00BFFF"]TES5Edit Plugin Cleaning Emporium[/color][/size]

Time to grab a cup of coffee.  I prefer a custom blend myself with Cinnamon, Chocolate, Vanilla and anything with the word cream in it like Butterscotch Cream.  Bring up your favorite music, light a fire (if you have a fireplace), get comfy in your favorite chair, and clean some Skyrim plugins.  With the release the of [url="http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1418088-relz-tes5edit/"]TES5Edit[/url] begins the continued saga started by ElminsterAU.  Previous versions of FO3Edit (Fallout 3), FNVEdit (Fallout: New Vegas), and TES4Edit (Oblivion) have given us endless hours of gaming enjoyment.

Now if you have no idea what I am talking about then you are in the right place.  While everyone is discussing whether or not to sort Form Lists, and DIAL INFO information this thread will be a place you can post your plugin cleaning questions and get feedback from others like you that have never heard of cleaning plugins and have no idea why you need to be doing that.

The above list is a good place to start to become familiar with the cleaning process.  Also, although it's for FNVEdit there is a good [url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVKe51dRm2M&feature=plcp"]tutorial for FNVEdit[/url] that will be similar to TES5Edit's tutorials Gopher has planed.

I will be updateing this post as time goes on to bring attention to certain things.  However, what needs to be kept up to date are the CK Wiki pages that have been started.  They contain detailed information that simply doesn't need to be keep up to date here.  For now the screen shots don't match the text in the TES5Edit Mod Cleaning Tutorial because I'm working on it.  It does however show accurately what needs to be happening when you clean a plugin.  It shows how to use the colors to easily distinguish between a Regualr Edit and a Dirty Edit.  It will have more info as time goes on and new pages as well.

[*] - QUST aliases are no longer sorted by index
[*] - QUST stages are now sorted by stage index
[*] - Improved NavMeshes (thanks to Divstator)
[*] [TES5] FaceFX phonemes where empty after copying RACE record.
[*] [TES5] Fixed bugs when copying RACE and QUST (empty model was created for RACE; QUST location aliases were turning into ref ones).
[*] [TES5] Create start-enabled quests sequence SEQ file (you can select several files at once).
[*] [TES5] Improved error checking.
[*] [FNV] CHAL record was missing some challenge types from Dead Money DLC.

[*] No autosaves when "you know what you are doing".
[*] Compare with external tool option in Edit window.
[*] "Apply Filter for Cleaning" menu. Note that xEdit saves filter settings when you press OK button in filter window, so if you clean plugin and exit the program, your filter settings will be preserved.
[*] Filter option for deleted records.
[*] Saving messages to [TES5/FNV/FO3/TES4]Edit_log.txt upon exit.
[*] Fixed minor bug when Edit can't find game's folder. If your registry settings is invalid due to a Steam bug and Edit is unable to find your game, put it in the game's root folder where the game executable file is (Oblivion.exe, TESV.exe, etc).
[*] [color="#FF0000"]- Reason: The game's Registry entry is missing. This happens to a lot of people, because Steam likes to remove it whenever the game is updated or its game cache is verified. Run the game's launcher to add the Registry entry back again.[/color]

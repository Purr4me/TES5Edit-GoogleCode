=======================================
	- Creature dialog - Finished (1 March 2003)
	- Cell reference dialog, display references, clean references - Finished (1 March 2003)
	- Add pointer array sort/search.  For small arrays (~100) the search time is the same, for
	  medium arrays (~10000) the binary search is about x10 faster.  For large arrays (~60000)
	  the search time is about x35 faster.  Load time is slightly increased as the array must
	  be sorted as it is created (used one qsort() at end after load instead of adding records
	  as sorted, much faster). Note that the standard bsearch() algorithm is ~10% slower that 
	  the custom binary search used.  Finished (1 March 2003).
    - Add sound button to Info Dialog for Voice records (2 March 2003)
	- Journal edit dialog (2 March 2003).
	- Simple load progress dialog (2 March 2003)
	- Plugin author/desc dialog (2 March 2003)
	- Drag records from cell reference list (3 March 2003)
	- Properly sortable list when loading a plugin. Sort by filename or plugin type (Master, 
	  Active, Regular) Default sort is alphabetical with all the master files at the top.  This
	  makes finding a particular plugin much faster if you have lots of them (3 March 2003).
	- Basic find text in all records (3 March 2003)
	- Display of INFO function values in the dialogue list.  Values display not only the function/ID
	  for the function, but also the value compared against allowing one to quickly gather more 
	  information at a quick glance (ex: TESCK would display just "Choice" or "Gold_001" but 
	  MWEdit would display "Choice == 1" or "Gold_001 >= 10000").  Resizable dialogue window. 
	  (13 March 2003).
    - Resize the dialogue info window (13 March 2003).
    - Corrected the error with the plugin backup for a Save As command (14 March 2003).
	- Corrected the local variable list in the dialogue info window (15 March 2003).
	- Compiler graciously adds spaces in places where they might be required/expected by the
	  game (such as in if statements etc...). (15 March 2003).
	- Local variable list for INFO functions (15 March 2003).
    - Script compiling (16 March 2003, 5 April 2003)
		- set locals
		- set globals
		- set local object reference
		- set to number/local/global/function (with/without object reference)
		- if/elseif/while (local/global/obj-ref rel-op number/local/global)
		- MessageBox function (1/2 args, 0 or more buttons)
		- General functions (functions need to be double checked for input argument size)
		- reset function argument (not sure how it is supposed to be implemented in TESCK?)
		- Local object/script variable access (object.localvar, script.localvar)
		- Checks object types more rigourously
		- Animation groups/indices
		- Ensure that new scripts have the correct sub-record order (SCVR SCDT SCTX) 
		- Script textbox limited to 32768 characters.
		- All functions/formats tested.
	- ESS save games can be edited moderately well (must be in the Data Files directory) (5 April 2003).
	- Drag records from one document to another (including DIAL) (5 April 2003)
	- Create Copy and Rename right-click context menu options in main list (5 April 2003)
	- INFO parent DIAL record properly set on record copy. (5 April 2003)
	- All cell contents (object references) copied properly on copy/rename (5 April 2003)
	- Cell local reference count copied properly now (5 April 2003)
	- Script compiles on save automatically (no error messages output) (6 April 2003)
	- Script import and export text (6 April 2003)
	- Fixed bug with duplicate records in plugin/master not correctly being found (6 April 2003) 
	- Went back to adding records as sorted initially instead of adding and sorting later. It
	  is faster the former way but only if one file is being loaded. With two or more (especially
	  for large masters) the latter is much faster in the end. (10 April 2003).
    - Book text limit changed from 32000 to 65536 as in TESCK (22 April 2003).
	- Added a file date column to the open plugin dialog. Plugins are sorted by Type then Date
	  by default (as in the TESCS) (4 August 2003).
    - Reset tokens for the script compiler now accept numeric values (31 August 2003).
    - Added the Bloodmoon functions (31 August 2003)
			BecomeWereWolf
			GetPCinJail 
			GetPCTraveling 
			GetWerewolfKills 
			IsWerewolf
			PlaceAtMe
			SetWereWolfAcrobatics
			TurnMoonRed
			TurnMoonWhite
			UndoWerewolf
	- Added a topic column in the find dialog for INFO records. For INFO records the parent 
	  dialogue is opened for editting instead of the INFO itself (1 September 2003).
    - Corrected the GetItemType() method for the Dialogue record type to properly return the
	  right type string (1 September 2003).
	- All dialogue type edit windows now display the correct record type string (1 September 2003).
	- New/modified INFOs are properly added to both RecInfo arrays. Fixed bug when editting dialogue
	  topics and all INFOs would disappear (1 September 2003).
	- Can now properly change the dialogue topic ID and result in a new dialogue topic with a copy
	  of all the dialogue's INFOs (1 September 2003). Note that the original dialogue is not deleted
	  like it is in TESCS (you can do it manually if desired).
	- Proper icon for the find dialog (1 September 2003).
	- Added Ctrl+C/V/X shortcuts for text boxes in all record editing windows (1 September 2003).
	- Added the function help window to the help menu (2 September 2003).
	- Added the message list view in a splitter pane at the bottom of the script window for 
	  displaying the errors/warnings from the last compile. Double-clicking a message will jump
	  to that point in the file. (4 September 2003).
	- Script and application icons added (4 September 2003).
	- Added the detailed error view for the script compiler messages. Added the right-click
	  context for the error list to view the error details, copy message to clipboard, goto 
	  the error in the script, or view the function help window. (6 September 2003).
	- Added the options dialog for modifying the various user options. Saves/loads the settings
	  from the registry. (7 September 2003).
	- The script compiler checks the type of function arguments better now, especially in the
	  few cases where there are several records with the same ID (7 September 2003).
	- The script compiler is stricter on local variable names than the TESCS compiler. For
	  instance the latter will allow names like "end" but the former won't as "end" is considered
	  a reserved word. This is a minor difference and being stricter is probably a good thing
	  (7 September 2003). 
	- Added the history list for the find dialog for past searches. Currently saves the last 10
	  searches (7 September 2003).
	- Added the default author name to the options dialog which is used to set default author
	  for new plugins (7 September 2003).
	- Editting an INFO record from the find dialog now displays the dialog and the info
	  edit dialog (not just the dialog topic). Corrected a bug where modified INFO records
	  would not be updated in the list (7 September 2003).
	- The last sort field in the main record view is now saved when switching between record
	  types. For instance, if you sort the weapons by Value, the next time you switch back to
	  the weapon view they will still be sorted by Value (instead of the default sort field)
	  (8 September 2003).
	- Dialogue edit window now saves the column widths when the record is saved and closed
	  (13 September 2003).
	- The dialogue record (and other related records) dialogue now will not save any changes
	  to the INFO records if the user presses cancel (13 September 2003). 
	- INFO records can now be cleaned and deleted. INFO records cannot be cleaned unless the
	  previous record has the same Prev/Next IDs (13 September 2003).
	- Start scripts can be editted now (13 September 2003).
	- Input dialog's initial focus is the main input textbox (14 September 2003).
	- Container record dialog now properly implements the item count storage. Previously, the 
	  item count would be messed up if you opened two or more containers that had the same
	  item in them (14 September 2003).
	- Similarily fixed the same item/record count bug for the NPC item list, Creature item list,
	  levelled creature list, and the levelled item list. The levelled lists are done in a slightly
	  different (and not particularily 'good') way since they allow multiple entries of the same
	  record (14 September 2003).
	- Creature and NPC item list now allow multiple selections and the ability to increase/decrease
	  the item count using the +/- keys (14 September 2003).
    - You can select a function in the script dialog and select "Func Help" from the right-click
	  context menu to view help for that function (15 September 2003).
	- For the script compiler, animation groups can now be enclosed by quotes (15 September 2003).
	- Script functions test and output verifications:
			- All A/C/D/E/F/H/J/K/L/O/P/R/S/U-Z functions (15 September 2003).
			- All G functions. Fixed minor bug in GetDetected output (15 September 2003).
			- All M functions, except MessageBox. Found 2 unknown ModRegion parameters (15 September 2003).
			- MessageBox function (16 September 2003).
			- Set command in various formats. Fixed a bunch of minor differences in compiled output
			  (16 September 2003).
			- Error/warning returned if the maximum number of variables/buttons are exceeded in
			  a MessageBox function call (9 each). An error is also returned if you use a number
			  for a variable value (only locals/globals allowed). Does not yet support strings for
			  variables (16 September 2003).
			- Strengthened the warning level of some compiler messages, i.e., some messages that
			  were warnings by default are now errors (16 September 2003).
	- Moved to using SourceForge for source control, documents, and downloading.


  v0.4.2 (not released)
=======================================
	- Added Move Up/Down to the dialogue context menu (21 September 2003).
	- Find Text and Plugin Info menu commands are now available when the current window
	  isn't the main view (24 September 2003).
	- Made the site link in the about dialog clickable (24 September 2003).
	- Load dialog made a litle clearer (24 September 2003).
	- Cleaning records now 'dirties' the document's modify flag (24 September 2003).
	- Fixed bug with the field ID value (changed from 1000 to 200) being too high (conflicted with a 
	  sublist field mask) which caused no IDs to be displayed in the cell reference list (24 September 2003). 
	- Added the CEsmLand class for landscape records (26 September 2003).
	- Fixed a bug in the compiled output for local variable references ("script.local"). Local variable
	  references are now only supported on the left side of set statements (29 September 2003).
	- Corrected the lack of statement count in compiled script output in if blocks (30 September 2003).
	- Fixed the while compiled script output (30 September 2003).
	- Tested and verified that IF/WHILE statements are correctly compiled (30 September 2003).
	- Globals less than 4 bytes in size are correctly output in if statements (5 October 2003).
	- Script compiler quickly tested by recompiling all/most scripts in my furniture plugin and 
	  playing the game (5 October 2003).


  v0.5.0 (released 5 October 2003)
=======================================
	- Properly implemented the FRMR cell reference index/flag sub-record. The reference index
	  is now displayed in the reference list for debugging/hacking purposes (5 October 2003).
	- Added an e-mail link to the toolbar/help menu. Corrected the omission of the links
	  help sub-menu when a document is open (5 October 2003).
	- Added Skirandi's item index as a help file. Added links to the function/index help on the 
	  toolbar (5 October 2003).
	- The cell dialog has been changed so that all changes to cell references are not saved until
	  you press the 'Save' button (like every other dialog). Thus, you can use the 'Cancel' button
	  to discard any changes made since the cell was opened for editting (5 October 2003).
	- Added options to the cell references for editting, cleaning, copying, undeleting and 
	  deleting (right click on the cell reference list). You can select multiple records to 
	  perform the actions on. Double-clicking the cell reference now defaults to displaying 
	  the reference edit page (5 October 2003).
	- Added the "Info" option to display what records use another record. Accessed by right-
	  clicking on the main object view. Scripts and dialog results are searched for possible
	  reference uses as well. Not yet confirmed whether the search algorithim might return
	  false positives (6 October 2003).
	- Made the results textbox on the INFO dialog scrollable so you can see/edit more than
	  the first four lines (6 October 2003).
	- Added simple function tooltips in the script dialog. You can enable/disable them from
	  the Options menu (11 October 2003).
	- Fixed a bug when using the +/- in the list controls which caused the selection to change
	  (13 October 2003).
	- Fixed a bug in the array sorting/finding routine that rarely resulted in records not
	  being able to be found (which would appear as a variety of problems) (13 October 2003).
	- Fixed bug when choosing one active file then another which resulted in the files being
	  loaded incorrectly (13 October 2003).
	- Added the ability to import multiple records from CSV text files. This will allow you
	  to mass create a bunch of records in a spreadsheet program and get them easily into your
	  plugin. All (or almost all) of the record fields can be input in the CSV, unlike the 
	  TESCS CSV files which only list certain parameters. The field values are choosen from
	  the header row in the CSV (a proper documentation will be coming). Currently only Misc.
	  records are supported for import (13 October 2003).
	- Implemented shortcut keys (Ctrl+C, etc...) in find dialog and script template view 
	  (15 October 2003).
	- Added context menus to the find and uses dialogs. This includes the new 'Select Item'
	  which selects the given item in the main list view (15 October 2003).
	- Fixed the script edit button in NPC and Creature dialogs (15 October 2003).
	- The previous filename is used when choosing model/texture/icon/sound files (18 October 2003).
	- The Find Text command now finds text properly in INFO functions (18 October 2003).
	- Fixed the bug which would prevent you from having more than one new plugin open at a
	  time (3 November 2003).
	- Fixed the script edit button on the start script dialog. Also fixed the script edit
	  button for all dialogs where the script shares its ID with another record (like a 
	  dialogue or cell) (3 November 2003). 
	- Fixed the proper compiling of script local variable reference when the object 
	  is enclosed in quotes (ex: set "object".local to something) (3 November 2003).


  v0.5.5 (released 5 November 2003)
=======================================
	- Fixed bug in CSV export which would cause the ItemType field to be not filled in for
	  some record types (4 Jan 2003).
	- Yes/No type values in CSV files will be properly imported now (4 Jan 2003).
	- Added the NPC for CSV export/imports (4 Jan 2003).


  v0.5.6 (Build 55, 5 January 2004)
=======================================



  v0.6.0-RC1 (Build 0, 24 August 2006)
=======================================
	- Improved indexing of records which roughly halves the loading time and speeds up record
	  lookups in general.
	- Checks for duplicate IDs greatly speeded up using the improved record indexing.
	- Added link to UESP Wiki on the function help page (jumps to the appropriate article).
	- Added the custom game data path to the options. If this value is blank the default MW
	  data path from the registry is used (if found). Specify a custom "Data Files" path
	  if you wish to load files from an alternate game location.
	- Fixed the bug where the open dialog would crash if it found a file with a date set
	  far in the future.
	- Merged in the v0.9.2a MWSE changes and custom function definitions. All custom functions
	  are defined the "CustomFunctions.dat" file which allows one to add new function definitions
	  as needed without requiring a recompile. See the data file for an explanation of how
	  to edit/add new functions.
	- Fixed bug in script compiler which would incorrectly output if() statements when they 
	  appeared directly after certain function calls.
	- Added the "backup saves" option which allows you to disable the automatic save backup
	  option which is enabled by default.
	- Corrected the definition of the SetWereWolfAcrobatics function.
	- The error view at the bottom of the script dialog now shows up initially.
	- Added the "no compile prompt" option which disables the popup message box after a 
	  script is compiled. The final compile message is added to the end of the messages
	  in the error list at the bottom of the script window.
	- Added the "extra file" option. When this is enabled the given file is loaded and used
	  if a certain record is not found in the current file. For example, the extra file 
	  contains the "player" record. If you load an ESP without the Morrowind.esm master file
	  you can still compile scripts using the "player" object by enabling this option. Any
	  record type is supported in the extra file (globals, NPCs, scripts, etc...).
	- Added basic undo functionality to the script editor (Ctrl-Z, the right-click
	  context menu or via the Undo button). 
	- Rearranged the function help page slightly and added the v0.9.2a MWSE functions. Note 
	  the MWSE functions don't yet have an article on the Wiki.
	- Modified the weapon dialog to prevent scripts from being applied on thrown, arrow, and
	  bolt weapons.
	- New NPCs will have initial values set for their race, class, hair, and head if there
	  are any available. This is to try to prevent the Construction Set from crashing when
	  editing the AI packages of an NPC with a missing race/class/hair/head.
	- Added the "Strict Object IDs" options. When enabled it works the same as previous
	  versions where only certain new object IDs are allowed. When disabled you can use
	  pretty much any ID as long as it starts with a letter, number, or underscore.
	- Added a bunch of the "Toggle..." and other functions as used in MW-Enhanced to the
	  custom function file.


v0.6.0-RC2 (Build 0, 27 August 2006)
=======================================
	- Fixed crash when cleaning a record.
	- Changed the cell name to force an output of a terminating null character to try and prevent
	  the cell renaming bug.
	- Fixed bug when compiling scripts with the "extra file" enabled.
	- Fixed generation of new Info/StartScript IDs which resulted in a bad ID in some cases.
	- Corrected the default "extra file" name to match the distributed file.
	- Fixed crash when dragging in script editor.
	- Added undo for dragging text in script editor.
	- Fixed crash/error in script editor caused by undo in some cases.
	- Changed valid script if() syntax. Now allows operators, and functions on both sides
	  and reference calls on the left side. Ensure to enclose both sides of the comparison
	  operator in brackets to ensure it compiles correctly in the Construction Set, eg:

				WRONG:		if (  Var1 * Var2 + 10  >=  Var2/109  )
				CORRECT:	if ( (Var1 * Var2 + 10) >= (Var2/109) )

	- Changed how extra variables are checked at the end of function calls to prevent some
	  errors when functions are used in if() statements.
	- Tabs will now undo in the script editor.
	- Added the 'Indent' button to the script toolbar. When used it attempts to automatically
	  indent the script according to the current settings. This action can be undone.
	- Added various identation settings in the options dialog. 
	- Added the following console functions to the script compiler:
			CenterOnCell
			CenterOnExterior
			FillMap
			FixMe
			ToggleAI
			ToggleCollision
			ToggleFogOfWar
			ToggleGodMode
			ToggleMenus
			ToggleSky
			ToggleVanityMode
			ToggleWorld
	  Verified script output matches 100% to that produced in the CS with the above functions.


v0.6.0-RC3 (Build 0, September 2006)
=======================================
	- Renamed "Ingrediant" to "Ingredient" on UI components.
	- Changed the enchantment type "Cast Strikes" to "Cast On Strike".
	- Added a bunch of AI data/flag columns to the right side of the NPC list.
	- The 'ifx' and 'whilex' keywords now ident properly in the script editor.
	- Fixed bug when renaming a record that would incorrectly change the name original record.
	- The infos listed in a dialogue should now be correct. Dialogues also should be properly
	  copied and renamed now along with their associated infos.
	- When cleaning a record its edit window is automatically closed if open.
	- Fixed misspelling of xRefType in function data files.
	- Fixed a script compile bug with local variable references (eg: set SomeObject.LocalVar to 1)
	  which would output incorrect data in some cases.
	- Local variables can now be checked in if statements, ex:
			if ( SomeObject.LocalVar == 1 )
	- Checked output of whilex(i) using one character local variables as mentioned as a possible
	  bug. Seems to be the same as multi-character variables and is the same output as MWEditSE.
	- The while statement now accepts extended expression like the if statement. This also fixes
	  a bug with some while statements being output incorrectly.
	- Fixed bug when using extended functions within an if/while block (incorrect block size was
	  begin output).
	- Blank lines in scripts are no longer idented when using auto-indent.
	- Script text is no longer selected when a script is opened.
	- Added the "Script Compare" option to the test menu to help in quickly confirming compiled
	  script output matches that of the CS. To use, create a plugin with one or more scripts to
	  test. Compile one copy in the CS and one copy in MWEdit. Select the "Script Compare" and
	  open the copy compiled in the CS. The script compare window will open and show the basic
	  comparison results from the compiled data.
	- Fixed bug which prevented the SameFaction function from being compiled.
	- Fixed script compile bug related to outputting some functions incorrectly (was due to the 
	  recent change in how functions are parsed).
	- The omitted comma warning in function calls has been disabled at all warning levels.
	- Corrected the current values for the animation groups. The animation opcodes have changed
	  sometime between the original version of the CS and the latest version.
	- Added some missing animation codes added in a previous patch or expansion. It is unsure
	  whether any of these codes have a valid use in a script.

	  New groups that have multiple opcodes use the lowest opcode value. See 

				http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes3Mod:Animation_Groups

	  for the complete list of valid animation groups.
	- The script find dialog defaults to a down direction.
	- Added the GetLOS function as as short form for GetLineOfSight.
	- GetPCRank not accepts an optional faction parameter. Output in typical uses verified
	  to 100% of that output by the CS.
	- Removed the "Local variable 'var' conflicts an object ID" warning.
	- Fixed bug with script undo when overwriting selected text with a character or paste
	  operation.
	- Fixed script compiler bug which would insert an extra "-" in if() statements in
	  some cases.
	- Lots of other minor improvements to the script compiler to ensure it matches the
	  output of the CS as closely as possible.
	- Included the MwEditScriptTest.esp file which was used to verify the output of the 
	  script compiler matches as close to possible the output from the CS. The scripts
	  starting with "testbar" are known to contain issues:

			testbad_aiwander:	AiWander calls with reset are output strangely from the CS.
			testbad_if3:		If/set expressions with negatives are output differently by the CS
								but the final result is the same.
			testbad_random1:
			testbad_random2:	Random is just messed up by the CS but the 'correct' output
								from MWEdit seems to work just fine.

	  All other scripts are verified to compile in MWEdit to exactly the same as from the CS.
	- Added the "Allow Bloodmoon" and "Allow Tribunal" options. When checked they allow the
	  expansion specific script functions to be used (you'll receive an error/warning message
	  otherwise). When "Allow Tribunal" is checked you can also use the extended set of
	  animation groups. This feature does not currently recognize changes in existing
	  functions made in the expansions, only new functions added in the expansion.
	- Added a script compiler warning if a '34th' local variable is used.
	- Improved the operation the function help command in the right-click context menu of
	  the script editor.
        - Added the 'Compile Active Scripts' command in the Edit menu which attempts to compile 
          all scripts in the active plugin.


v0.6.1 (28 Nov 2006)
=======================================
	- Globals that conflict with other IDs (eg: Stonghold is both a global and a topic) should
	  now compile fine in scripts. Need confirmation this works everwhere but some simple tests
	  seem to indicate it is working.
	- Added console function abbreviations to the valid scripting functions.
	- Globals now work in scripts when the 'extra file' option is enabled.	  
	- Records with duplicate IDs should work better with the script compiler.
	- String globals are now accepted in the script compiler. There still may be situations
	  where the CS accepts a string but MwEdit does not. 
	- The 'Choice' function should now be supported and properly compiled in scripts. Only basic
	  checking of its function arguments are done due to its special syntax when output in scripts.
	- The "compile all scripts" feature now outputs errors/warnings to a simple textbox dialog. All
	  compile messages are also output to the Mwedit.log text file. Note that when compiling a 
	  large number of scripts not all messages may display in the final message dialog.
    - A blank/empty book teaches skill will now import correctly from a CSV file.
	- Plugins with duplicate IDs will now properly display those records.
	- Note that compiling scripts is slightly (20%) slower now due to the required checking for
	  duplicate IDs. This is particularily noticable when compiling multiple scripts. For example, 
	  compiling all scripts in Morrowind.esm takes around a minute (there is no progress bar).
	- Added link to the Tes3Mod:Modding page on the UESP to the help menu and toolbar.
	- Added the 'Make Active' command to the main record list context menu. This moves all 
	  selected records to the active plugin.
	- Improved support for the unary minus operation in scripts. For example:

			set local to -(6 + global1)
			set local to -player->getpos x

	  Note that the CS seems to not handle complex unary minus operations very well and may 
	  output invalid compiled data in those cases.
	- Fixed crash when compiling a function call within another function.
	- PlaceItem/PlaceItemCell now compile properly when called with variables.
	- Main window can be maximized without it reverting when a record window is opened.
	  Script and dialogue windows operate in the same manner.
	- 'reset' is no longer a reserved word in scripts. Added a few more checks to allow
	  local/global variables named 'reset'.

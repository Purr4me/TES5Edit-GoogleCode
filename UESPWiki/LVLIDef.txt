| + || EDID || editorId || zstring || Editor id
|-
| + || OBND || objectBounds|| [[Tes5Mod:Mod File Format/OBND Field|OBND]] ||  Seems to always be 12 zeroes
|-
| + || LVLD || unknown  || int8    || Chance for an item on this list to not be spawned at all (IE, 75 means there's a 25% to spawn an item).
|-
| + || LVLF || unknown  || int8    || Flags:
:0x01=All levels (sets it to calculate for all entries < player level, choosing randomly from all the entries under)
:0x02=Each (sets it to repeat a check every time the list is called (if it's called multiple times), otherwise it will use the same result for all counts.)
:0x04=Use all (use all entries when the list is called)
:0x08=Special loot
|-
| + || LLCT || unknown  || int8    || The number of entries in the list (the number of LVLO entries, essentially).
|-
| rowspan=3 | * || rowspan=3 | LVLO || rowspan=3 | level || ulong || The level set for the entry.  Reference level appears to be set by player level only?  Affected by level scaling multipliers?
|-
| formID || The item or LVLI used by the entry.
|-
| ulong  || How many items are added or used when this list is called.
|-
| + || LVLG || Global  || formid    || Points to a global record. Records with this set usually have chance none set at 100%. Likely the value of the global affects the change none value or use of the list.

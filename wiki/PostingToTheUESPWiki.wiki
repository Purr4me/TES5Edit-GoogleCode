Those updating the wiki can navigate to this page and click on one of the records.

For this example I'm going to use MISC since it isn't really formated properly and contains the same information you will receive in a ticket from one of the decoders. To get started click the edit tab.

For what our project is doing we only need to use the 'edit' tab at the top.  All the changes are shown under the history tab.

Copy the text from the white text box to an editor of choice.  I suggest Notepad++ with the Aspell dictionary plugin installed.

Save the information to a txt file in the UESPWiki folder for our SVN.  Chose the name of the record, followed by Def.   For the above example I called it MISCDef.txt.

The first time I tried to edit a record I chose to just cut and paste from other records to start with and then start making changes.  I chose to cut and paste the formatting from the DOOR record for now but changes need to be made.

After you make corrections to the fields they should start to reflect the values of the actual record you are submitting to the wiki.  In this case I am editing the MISC record.  When you are done making changes save all the text you are submitting to the file you made for it in the UESPWiki folder.

You can preview your changes before submitting them.

This is just a brief example of what to do.  You need to go to the bug tracker and assign a ticket to yourself, update the site, and close the ticket.  If a ticket is made for the same record you edited once before it's because there are changes and new information to add.

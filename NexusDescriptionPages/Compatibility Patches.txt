Check out the new banners that [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/69377]Grace Darkling[/url] made for me.  That was a sweet and appreciated Christmas Gift.  I added a few in game Christmas shots of my own.

Aside from the compatibility patches here are some videos that can help you understand more about preparing your game and reducing potential issues.  I also have two on installing Wrye Bash and BOSS.

[size=4][color=#FF8C00]Overview:[/color][/size]

These are files I have used in the past that are now updated and cleaned with TES5Edit.  Some files require the original authors mods.  To install simply install the esp over the original authors mod to use.  If you use NMM when prompted to overwrite choose yes.

I will update various mods as time permits.  These are not simply loaded into the CK and then saved.  Any information the CK does not like, such as out of order subrecords may be striped out of the mod once you save it.  So that is not the best way to resolve issues with plugins and just creates more incompatibility with other mods and potential CTDs.

[size=4][color=#FF8C00]Requests:[/color][/size]

Thanks for all the kind words I am glad to hear that for some this is really relieving some CTDs.  You guys are welcome.  I don't mind requests but I have discovered that if the plugin does not have out of order subrecords, loading it into the CK, saving it, and cleaning it with TES5Edit is all it needs.  Please don't ask for a patch if it does not have out of order subrecords.

[size=4][color=#FF8C00]How To Install:[/color][/size]

Download the author's original mod listed below, unless otherwise specified, then install the esp provided into your data folder and overwrite the old esp or esm files with the ones I have provided.

TES5Edit will complain about the VMAD in an EXPL record, just ignore that.  I have not found a suitable replacement yet.

Version 3 no longer requires the original mod, and the Eyepatch is  properly assigned to slot 55 as mentioned in the [url=http://www.creationkit.com/Biped_Object]CK Wiki[/url].  Now you can use the patch with a hood for example.  They are still available in both Clothing and Light Armor and, can be purchased from Grelka in Riften.

[size=4][color=#FF8C00]Looking for Help with Dovahkiin Hideout:[/color][/size]

I am looking for people who have knowledge with Dialogue, Quests, and voice overs for NPCs.  One of my biggest projects that will be the most difficult is fixing Dovahkiin Hideout.  I may have worked on the update for TES5Edit and I know the technical aspects of records and how many bytes some of the subrecords have, but I am new to modding and I could use the help on that mod.  There is another that has some issues I want to fix but it's probably due to oversights more then being pre ck and potentially made with snip.

Update (01/2013): He made some changes and after doing so I tweaked the files a bit.  I sent him two versions  and one is specifically for Hearthfires.  There will need to be more work done to get the NPCs talking again and the PACK and AI needs to be reworked.  Hopefully I can learn how or he will have a little spare time to do it.

[size=4][color=#FF8C00]FAQ:[/color][/size]

Q: I want to use one of your patches with SkyRe or the ReProccer.  My question is, [insert question here]?
A: I don't discuss anything related to SkyRe or the ReProccer.  Direct all questions to the appropriate forums or authors.

Q: I made changes to the original authors plugin so it would work with SkyRe and the ReProccer.  Should I use your patch and make the same changes or, should I continue using the plugin I have already made changes to?
A: That is your choice.  I don't discuss anything related to SkyRe or the ReProccer.  

Q: Can you update your patch to be compatible with SkyRe?
A: I don't discuss anything related to SkyRe.  Direct all requests to the the original author of the plugin.

Q: Can you upgrade your patch to work with [insert plugin name here].esp.
A: No. Feel free to use the plugin with TES5Edit or the CK and make any changes to it you like.  I have contacted all the authors to the plugins I host but some of them have not responded yet.  The ones that have responded have given me permission to host the patch.  If you want to host a file based off my patch you should ask permission of the original author.

Q: Can you upgrade your patch to work current DLC?
A: I don't update the plugins for Dawnguard, Dragonborn, or Hearthfires, unless I feel it is needed to prevent a CTD.  An example of this is the Dovahkiin Hideout when used with Hearthfires.

Q: What do you change?
A: I don't keep a change log and I will not make one ever, so don't ask.  Here are the most common things I change: a) I change null FormIDs (00000000) to something that the CK or Skyrim can work with. b) I correct out of order subrecords. c) I load the plugin into the CK. d) I clean the plugin with TES5Edit. e) I check the plugin with TES5Edit using the "Check for Errors" routine.

Q: Do you provide instructions on how to fix plugins with out of order subrecords or plugins corrupted by previous versions of TESVSnip (4.2 and 4.3.x)?  Are there any resources out that you can direct me to? 
A: I don't provide this information, so don't ask.  There are far too many people that can't clean plugins with TES5Edit even after reading the Wiki pages and watching videos.  I am not about to trouble shoot someone else's mistakes.

Q: When I use your plugin all my items disappear from my inventory, why does that happen?
A: Your save game has references in it from the original plugin.  You should continue to use the original plugin until you start a new character.

Q: When I use your plugin I get an instant CTD, why does that happen?
A: Your save game has references in it from the original plugin.  You should continue to use the original plugin until you start a new character.

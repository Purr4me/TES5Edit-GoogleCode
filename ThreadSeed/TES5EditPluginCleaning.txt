[size="4"][color="#00BFFF"]TES5Edit Plugin Cleaning Emporium[/color][/size]

Time to grab a cup of coffee.  I prefer a custom blend myself with Cinnamon, Chocolate, Vanilla and anything with the word cream in it like Butterscotch Cream.  Bring up your favorite music, light a fire (if you have a fireplace), get comfy in your favorite chair, and clean some Skyrim plugins.  With the release the of [url="http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25859/"]TES5Edit[/url] begins the continued saga started by ElminsterAU.  Previous versions of FO3Edit (Fallout 3), FNVEdit (Fallout: New Vegas), and TES4Edit (Oblivion) have given us endless hours of gaming enjoyment.

Now if you have no idea what I am talking about then you are in the right place.  While everyone is discussing whether or not to sort Form Lists, and DIAL INFO information this thread will be a place you can post your plugin cleaning questions and get feedback from others like you that have never heard of cleaning plugins and have no idea why you need to be doing that.

[color=#00BFFF]TES5Edit Updates:[/color]

[color=#FF0000]With each new version of TES5Edit you may want to restore plugins from backups and reclean them. Otherwise any fixes and updates to cleaning process won't take effect.[/color]

[color=#00BFFF]Version 3.0.29 contains the following changes:[/color]

- [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/921884-icons-for-tes5edit/]New Icon[/url] provided by moiman100.
- [TES5] more information is decoded (Records ARMA, NVSI, MOD2, LVLO).
- [TES5] Every string value gets own ID when localizing plugin
- [TES5] Fixed error when copying VMAD scripts using drag & drop
- issue 104 : Files others than esp and esm (and ghost) are timestamped.
- issue  88 : Delete from the view pane column title contextual menu is disabled (due to a hard to reproduce bug). This is a workaround, not a fix.
- issue 119 : [TES5] The CK adds useless XLRL records when reverting a change. Those XLRL are considered benign and the record ITM.
- issue 110 : Check for errors now checks for invalid FormIDs. Also, new "Check for errors" sample script.
- Options are processed when they matter, not at the beginning.
- issue  82 : [TES5] Capitalization fixed in text are being treated as dirty edits. Description fields are case sensitive now.
Scripting:
- Scripts can use other scripts with standard pascal "uses" keyword.
- New functions available.
- New sample scripts.
Fixes:
- Compare to will not overwrite an existing file, nor will it leave temporary files behind.
- issue 125 : Condition added are no longer empty.
- issue 121 : Changing FormID of Region causes severe bugs. Reference building is delayed to after the change is done. Non region reference XCLR record are no longer removed.
- issue 120/118 : Reference not updated while adding a master. Reference lookup during the addition was sometimes unreliable. 
- issue 117 : Bug in script Undelete and Disable References.pas 
- issue 112 : Option "Simple Record" malfunctioning.
- issue 111 : AV when saving subrecords with prefixed arrays. Sizing and memory allocation are done properly during every phase.
- issue 108 : Very slow saving after editing ESM flag. Background updating limited as much as possible during saves.
- issue 107 : Copying a quest record causes extraneous script fragment data to be generated. Sizing and memory allocation issue.
- issue 106 : Error adding a new master to plugin with own navmeshes. Fire Union decider when they can effectively properly work, not before.
- issue 105 : Overwriting quest fragments or Quest Aliases may produce exceptions. During copy, memory is initialized properly before being used.
- issue 100 : Voice Type EditorID disappears. Memory sizing issue.
Known issue:
- issue 123 : Using Check for errors after sort master, before saving and reloading: the Cell FormID will not be updated. (that is a display issue only).
- issue 102 : Objects with property names but no assigned values don't display the names. The CK does not save the property name in the plugin in that case so it is correct.
Misc:
- issue 115 : "Backup plugin" checkbox anchored to bottom of form.
- avoid firing some cached exception (to ease debugging).

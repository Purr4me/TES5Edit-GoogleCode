=======================================
	- The Morrowind installation path is now read from the registry instead of 
	  being hard coded to my personal MW installation (29 Dec 2003).
	- Used the Windows long to short filename conversions in order to fit the 
	  texture filenames into the short 8.3 DOS format used by the 3DS format.
	  This requires the texture files to be copied from the CS CD onto the
	  hard drive (29 Dec 2003).
	- Errors/warnings/success will be properly displayed after a conversion
	  (29 Dec 2003).

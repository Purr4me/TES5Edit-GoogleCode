== Vertex Height Data ==

The VHGT record is a 3D mesh that has been highly optimized for storing landscape data.

Each data-point is a signed byte. Data starts from the bottom left cell position and is filled one row at a time. Each value of 1 equates to a height of 8 game units (assumed from Oblivion) so each data point has an incremental game unit range of -1024 to +1016. Each value of the leftmost column offsets the height of all vertex data at that row and to the north. All grid-points of the remaining 32x32 grid offset the height of all landscape at that point and all points to the east just on that row.

The height values for the four edges of the mesh must match the height values of the matching edge of neighboring landscape meshes. The bottom row values should join with the cell to its south. The left-most column likewise. The bottom row is a copy of the cell to the south's upper-most row. Likewise the left-most column is an copy of the cell to the west's right-most data column.

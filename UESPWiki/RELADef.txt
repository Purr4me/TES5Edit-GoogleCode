:Child NPC
|formid||

:Rank
|uint16||Relationship Level.  The value stored in the game data is unsigned integer ranging from 0 to 8 (although 7 is the highest value being used so far).  However, this is converted into a value ranging from -4 to 4, which is the value returned by GetRelationshipRank; negative values imply dislike/hatred whereas positive values are for friendship.  The meaning assigned to each value in the CK is (the first number is the raw value in the game data; the second number is the GetRelationshipRank value):
:0 - Lover (4)
:1 - Ally (3)
:2 - Confidant (2)
:3 - Friend (1)
:4 - Acquaintance (0)
:5 - Rival (-1)
:6 - Foe (-2)
:7 - Enemy (-3)
:8 - Archnemesis (-4)

|-
|
:Association Type

[size=4][color=#FF8C00]Overview:[/color][/size]

These are files I have used in the past that are now updated and cleaned with TES5Edit.  Some files require the original authors mods.

I will update various mods as time permits.  These are not simply loaded into the CK and then saved.  Any information the CK does not like, such as out of order subrecords may be striped out of the mod once you save it.  So that is not the best way to resolve issues with plugins and just creates more incompatibility with other mods and potential CTDs.

[size=4][color=#FF8C00]Requests:[/color][/size]

Thanks for all the kind words I am glad to hear that for some this is really relieving some CTDs.  You guys are welcome.  I don't mind requests but I have discovered that if the plugin does not have out of order subrecords, loading it into the CK, saving it, and cleaning it with TES5Edit is all it needs.  Please don't ask for a patch if it does not have out of order subrecords.

[size=4][color=#FF8C00]How To Install:[/color][/size]

Unless otherwise specified, download the author's original mod listed below.  Then install the esp provided into your data folder and overwrite the old esp or esm files with the ones I have provided.

[color=#FF0000]Does not require original mod[/color]
[color=#00FFFF]
New JaySuS Swords V14
- Updated both JSwords.esm and the JSwordsDistributionBalancePlugin.esp
- New update attempts to resolve crafting conditions.  Previously you could craft something if your Smithing was 50, now it's set to Greater or Equal to 50.  This attempts to resolve claims that some items cannot be crafted.
- I did not change what level of smihing is required to craft the item.  If JaySuS required you to be level 100 in smithing and your Character to be level 100 then it's still that way.

[size=4][color=#FF8C00]FAQ:[/color][/size]

Q: I want to use one of your patches with SkyRe or the ReProccer.  My question is, [insert question here]?
A: I don't discuss anything related to SkyRe or the ReProccer.  Direct all questions to the appropriate forums or authors.

Q: I made changes to the original authors plugin so it would work with SkyRe and the ReProccer.  Should I use your patch and make the same changes or, should I continue using the plugin I have already made changes to?
A: That is your choice.  I don't discuss anything related to SkyRe or the ReProccer.  

Q: Can you update your patch to be compatible with SkyRe?
A: I don't discuss anything related to SkyRe.  Direct all requests to the the original author of the plugin.

Q: Can you upgrade your patch to work with [insert plugin name here].esp.
A: No. Feel free to use the plugin with TES5Edit or the CK and make any changes to it you like.  I have contacted all the authors to the plugins I host but some of them have not responded yet.  The ones that have responded have given me permission to host the patch.  If you want to host a file based off my patch you should ask permission of the original author.

Q: Can you upgrade your patch to work current DLC?
A: I don't update the plugins for Dawnguard, Dragonborn, or Hearthfires, unless I feel it is needed to prevent a CTD.  An example of this is the Dovahkiin Hideout when used with Hearthfires.

Q: What do the patches do, Exactly?
A: I don't discuss this so don't ask.  The plugin I provide replaces the original authors plugin.  As the BOSS messages I have added to the masterlist explain, some mods were made before the Construction Kit was released.  Since there wasn't a working Construction Kit they were made with older versions of TESVSnip so the plugin is corrupt.  Some files were made after the release of the Construction Kit but were modified with earlier versions of TESVSnip so the plugin is corrupt.  

[color=#FF0000]NOTE: Any version of TESVSnip prior to version 4.4.x used to modify a plugin will corrupt the plugin.  However, that does not mean the current dev-version of TESVSnip is really any safer to use.  It has not undergone enough of an updating and testing to be used to make plugins.  Plugins should still be made with the Construction Kit.  When needed TES5Edit can be used on the plugin but, using TES5Edit to make extensive mod changes is discouraged – that's what the CK was built for.[/color]

Q: What do you change?
A: I don't post changes I have made to the file unless I feel the need to do so, so don't ask.  Here are the most common things I change: a) I change null FormIDs (00000000) to something that the CK or Skyrim can work with. b) I correct out of order subrecords. c) I load the plugin into the CK. d) I clean the plugin with TES5Edit. e) I check the plugin with TES5Edit using the "Check for Errors" routine.

Q: Do you provide instructions on how to fix plugins with out of order subrecords or plugins corrupted by previous versions of TESVSnip (4.2 and 4.3.x)?  Are there any resources out that you can direct me to? 
A: I don't provide this information, so don't ask.  There are far too many people that can't clean plugins with TES5Edit even after reading the Wiki pages and watching videos.  I am not about to trouble shoot someone else's mistakes.

Q: When I use your plugin all my items disappear from my inventory, why does that happen?
A: Your save game has references in it from the original plugin.  You should continue to use the original plugin until you start a new character.

Q: When I use your plugin I get an instant CTD, why does that happen?
A: Your save game has references in it from the original plugin.  You should continue to use the original plugin until you start a new character.

{{Trail|File Formats|Mod File Format}}
MUST records contain data regarding individual music "tracks".  Tracks usually consist of a single .wav but can have more than 1 along with conditional data.

There are also a handful of records that have the same functionality as MUSC, namely they are themselves a collection of MUST and not a single track.  These have the SNAM field and usually "Palette" in their EDID, no ANAM and were probably created prior to (or in spite of) the MUSC type.  Either an ANAM or an SNAM field are required.

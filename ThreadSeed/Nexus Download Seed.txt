[url=http://fallout3.nexusmods.com/mods/8629]Fallout3 Training Manual for FO3Edit[/url]: Applies to all game versions

Important for Older Systems:
If you get an error about d3dx9_*.dll not being installed, you need to update your DirectX to the most current version.

The most current (March 2008) version [url=http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35]DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer[/url] or for [url=here: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23611]DirectX End-User Runtimes Redistributable[/url]. (make sure to install it after unpacking it)

[color=#00BFFF]Version 3.0.23 contains the following changes:[/color]

- [TES5] Merged patch updated for Skyrim, currently it merges:
  * Leveled NPCs, Items, Spells
  * NPC: Items, Spells, Head Parts, Factions
  * Race: Hairs, Eyes, Spells
  * Containers
  * Relations
  * Form Lists
  * Keywords on: Armor, Weapon, Ammo, NPC
- [TES5/FNV/FO3] When performing UDR there will be a warning message for deleted NavMeshes.
- [TES5] Updated record definitions.
  * BPDT was sorted by a localized name which is inconsistent for different languages (now sorted by a node name)
  * NPC's tints are now sorted by tint index for better conflicts detection
  * QUST aliases are no longer sorted by index
  * QUST stages are now sorted by stage index
  * Improved NavMeshes (thanks to Divstator)
- [TES5] FaceFX phonemes where empty after copying RACE record.
- [TES5] Fixed bugs when copying RACE and QUST (empty model was created for RACE; QUST location aliases were turning into ref ones).
- [TES5] Create start-enabled quests sequence SEQ file (you can select several files at once).
- [TES5] Improved error checking.
- [FNV] CHAL record was missing some challenge types from Dead Money DLC.
- [FNV] Disabled DIAL sorting, was causing errors when copying INFO records.
- No autosaves when "you know what you are doing".
- Compare with external tool option in Edit window.
- "Apply Filter for Cleaning" menu. Note that xEdit saves filter settings when you press OK button in filter window, so if you clean plugin and exit the program, your filter settings will be preserved.
- Filter option for deleted records.
- Saving messages to [TES5/FNV/FO3/TES4]Edit_log.txt upon exit.
- Fixed minor bug when Edit can't find game's folder. If your registry settings is invalid due to a Steam bug and Edit is unable to find your game, put it in the game's root folder where the game executable file is (Oblivion.exe, TESV.exe, etc).
- Reason: The game's Registry entry is missing. This happens to a lot of people, because Steam likes to remove it whenever the game is updated or its game cache is verified. Run the game's launcher to add the Registry entry back again.

[color="#FF8C00"][size="4"][b]Current Progress:[/b][/size][/color]

Some aditional tweaking needs to be done but we are close to having on open beta.  About 90-95% of the records are decoded at this time.  I have started to update the UESPWiki and I keep a current list on our site in the [url=http://code.google.com/p/skyrim-plugin-decoding-project/wiki/UESPWikiUpdates]UESPWikiUpdates[/url].

[color="#FF8C00"][size="4"][b]Name:[/color][/size][/b] Skyrim Plugin Decoding Project

[color="#FF8C00"][size="4"][b]Summary:[/color][/size][/b] A collaborative project to decode Skyrim's record structure using TES5Dump and provide a working version of TES5Edit.

[color="#FF8C00"][size="4"][b]Description:[/color][/size][/b] TES5Dump (a.k.a. TES4Dump / FO3Dump / FNVDump) are utilities that dump the contents of a .esp or .esm plugin to a text file, using internal record definitions. By comparing its output with plugins of known contents, the record definitions can be tweaked until the correct structures have been decoded. TES5Dump also forms the plugin parsing backend for the TES5Edit utility. (a.k.a. TES4Edit / FO3Edit / FNVEdit)

Skyrim's record structure has not yet been fully decoded, and the Skyrim modding community suffers from the lack of a working TES5Edit.  This project's aim is to help the decoding effort by providing TES5Dump and allowing many people to update its definitions using Subversion, and to provide the TES5Edit utility. 

Its predecessors FNVEdit, FO3Edit, and TES4Edit by ElminsterAU are the best tools to use for exploring overlaps between mods and cleaning mods.  TES5Edit will have the same functionality since the compiled release will be made with the same TES4 back engine using the definitions as a result of this project.  He would work on it himself, but unfortunately suffers from a severe lack of spare time.  He has offered to compile TES5Edit after the necessary supporting files are changed for Skyrim's file format.   

This utility will let you easily see how multiple mods interact and override each other, as well as giving you a quick view of the changes that a plugin makes. It lets you browse a graphical record tree of your active plugins, revealing the values set by most record types and comparing overlapping changes from each active plugin.

When started it will automatically find your Skyrim Data directory. You then get a dialog to select which modules you want to load with the current selection from your plugins.txt as default value. Once you have confirmed that dialog the selected modules will start loading in the background.  The program will then work the same as its predecessors.

[color="#FF8C00"][size="4"][b]Why do we need TES5Dump:[/b][/size][/color]

[quote name='WrinklyNinja']
.snip. TES5Edit isn't the important thing in this scenario, what's important is getting the records decoded, because a whole load of things (Gecko, Bashed Patch, etc) require that, not just TES5Edit...[/quote]
[quote name='WrinklyNinja']
.snip. Because so much depends on the record decoding, it's sensible to open up the task to as many people as possible. As such, publicly hosting the definitions and the TES5Dump code/program is best for that. The plugin format has historically been documented at UESP.net for previous games, but I'm of the opinion that only verified decoded records should be documented there, so we still need a central location lots of people can read/write to. A SVN repository would be ideal...[/quote]

[color="#FF8C00"][size="4"][b]How TES5Dump works:[/b][/size][/color]

[quote name='ElminsterAU']
TES5Dump Is a command line utility that can take an esm/esp file, decode it, and give a human readable dump to the console. The output can be redirected to a file, so you could use:

TES5Dump Skyrim.esm > Skyrim.txt

To turn the whole master into a huge text file.

What works better when working on the record definitions is to create new .esp’s using the CK with just a single (or a few) records, of a single type, with specific values for all the different fields.

The process is then basically:
Create new .esp with example records
Run TES5Dump
Modify record definitions
Repeat till dump is correct
Repeat steps 2-4 until all possible record types and all possible fields are covered

[color="#FF8C00"][size="4"][b]What we need for this project:[/b][/size][/color]

We are looking for volunteers and TES enthusiasts who are willing to contribute their time in decoding Skyrim's files, and making updates to the UESP Wiki.

If you would like to participate in this project please send me a PM.

[color="#FF8C00"][size="3"][b]Wiki Updaters:[/b][/size][/color]

Any general knowledge of how to edit html and possibly xml.  After you have checked out the files the folder you will work with is UESPWiki.  It will contain templates of each record posted on UESPWiki.  To make changes to the [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes5Mod:Mod_File_Format]UESP Wiki[/url] site you need to register first.  Registration is free and hardly any information is required.

Please refer to the on site wiki: [url=http://code.google.com/p/skyrim-plugin-decoding-project/wiki/DecodingRecords]PostingToTheUESPWiki[/url] 

[color="#FF8C00"][size="3"][b]Record Decoders:[/b][/size][/color]

After you have checked out the files the folder you will work with is TES5Dump.  The only file you need to edit will be wbDefinitionsTES5.pas.
To compile the source you need a trial version of Delphi found here.  [url=https://downloads.embarcadero.com/free/delphi]embarcadero.com[/url]  The source is written in Delphi but you only need a basic knowledge with C++ or Java to interpret the Delphi code and figure out the references.
Having knowledge of or, experience in decoding the records in plugins would be extremely helpful as well.  The decoding is not programming intensive because all you are really doing is updating the pre existing routines for Skyrim's format.

[color="#FF8C00"][size="4"][b]Getting Set Up:[/b][/size][/color]

You will need an SVN client like [url=http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html]TortoiseSVN[/url] to submit your changes.  Instructions are listed [url=https://code.google.com/p/skyrim-plugin-decoding-project/wiki/NewMembersGettingStarted]here on Google Code.[/url]

[color="#FF8C00"][size="4"][b]Special Thanks:[/b][/size][/color]

|- 
| Unknown || uint32 || Possibly a flag for a data type: 0x00000020 if is island, 0x00000000 if not island but has been modified, 0x00000040 if not island and not modified.
|-
| X: || float32 || X center point of the navmesh.
|-
| Y: || float32 || Y center point of the navmesh.
|- 
| Z: || float32 || Z center point of the navmesh.
|- 
| Preferred Merges Flag || uint32 || 
|-
| Merged to || formid[num] || 
|-
| Preferred Merges || formid[num] || 
|-
| Linked Doors || struct Door[num] || Count of door REFR data.
|-
| Doors || struct Door || Unknown uint32 and Door REFR formid.
|-
| Is Island Flag || uint8 || Is island mesh flag. If it is an island, then a data structure follows.
|-
!colspan="3"|Beginning of data that only appears if the Is Island Flag = TRUE.
|-
| X: || float32 || rowspan=3 | This is the minimum X,Y and Z coordinate of the navmesh.
|-
| Y: || float32
|-
| Z: || float32
|-
| X: || float32 || rowspan=3 | This is the maximum X,Y and Z coordinate of the navmesh. This together with the Minimum X,Y and Z coordinate appear to represent a bounding box.
|-
| Y: || float32
|-
| Z: || float32
|-
| Triangle count || struct Triangle[num] || This is a count of triangles that make an estimated or summary navmesh.
|-
| Vertex index 0 || uint16 ||rowspan=3| struct Triangle: This is a structure made up of 3 vertex indexes. These indexes create a navmesh triangle by pointing into the vertex structure that follows this structure.
|-
| Vertex index 1 || uint16
|-
| Vertex index 2 || uint16
|-
| Vertex count || struct Vertex[num] || This is a count of Vertices in the array that follows.
|-
| X: || float32 ||rowspan=3| struct Vertex: This is a structure of X,Y and Z coordinates that make a vertex. This is the vertex that is referred to by the struct Triangle above.
|-
| Y: || float32
|-
| Z: || float32
|-
!colspan="3"|End of data that only appears if the Is Island Flag = TRUE.
|-
| Location Marker? || uint32 || Appears before location info.
|-
| World Space || formid || formid of the world space. If World Space = 0x0000003C then the following uint32 contains grid info, otherwise it contains a cell formid.
|-
| Cell/Grid || formid or sint16 & sint16 || formid of the cell unless World Space = 0x0000003C then it is a pair of signed integers that represent grid x and grid y.

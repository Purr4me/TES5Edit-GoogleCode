'''NVNM''' fields contain navmesh geometry data.

! width="20%" | Name
! width="20%" | [[Tes5Mod:File Format Conventions|Type/Size]]
! width="60%" | Info
|- 
| Unknown || uint32 || Seems to always be 12 or 0x0000000C. I suspect it's a copy of NVER.
|-
| Location Marker? || uint32 || Appears before location info.
|-
| World Space || formid || Formid of the world space. If World Space = 0x0000003C then the following uint32 contains grid info, otherwise it contains a cell formid.
|-
| Cell/Grid || formid or sint16 & sint16 || Formid of the cell unless World Space = 0x0000003C then it is a pair of signed integers that represent grid x and grid y.
|-
| Vertices || struct Vertex[num] || This is a count of vertices in the navmesh.
|-
| X: || float32 ||rowspan=3| struct Vertex: This is a structure of X,Y and Z coordinates that make up the vertices in the navmesh.
|-
| Y: || float32
|-
| Z: || float32
|- 
| Triangles || struct Triangle[num] || This is the count of struct Triangle.
|- 
|Vertex 0 || int16 ||rowspan=8|struct Triangle: This is a structure of 3 vertices, 3 edges, a cover marker and cover flags. The vertices hold the point identifiers that are displayed in the Creation Kit when you roll over a navmesh triangle. The edges are either -1 if they don't border another triangle, or they hold the index of the triangle they do border. The cover marker seems to be an indicator of where the cover flags begin and usually contains 0x0008 or 0x0408.

The cover flags are contained in a uint16 size of data. Only 2 edges of a triangle are allowed to have cover.

| External Connections || struct Connection[num] || This is a list of triangles that border other navmeshes
|-
| Unknown || uint32 || rowspan=3 | struct Connection: This struct is made up of an unknown int32, Navmesh formid and triangle index. The triangle index identifies the triangle that connects to the external navmesh, indicated by the navmesh formid.

| Door triangles || struct Door triangle[num] || This is a list of triangles at the door threshold.
|-
| Triangle || int16 || rowspan=3 | struct Door triangle: This is a list of triangles that lie at the threshold of their respective doors. The doors are identified by their form id. The unknown appears to be a marker for door REFR formids.
|-
| Unknown || uint32
|-
| Door REFR || formid
|-
| Cover triangles || int16[num] || This is a list of triangles that have cover.
|-
| Cover triangle || int16 || Index of triangle that has cover.
|-
| Divisor? || uint32 || This appears to be a divisor to determine distance. The formula is ABS(( MaxX - MinX ) / Divisor ) = Max X Distance.
(It may not necessarily be the maximum distance, but the formula fits the result).
|-
| Max X Distance || float32 || This is result for X from the formula above.
|-
| Max Y Distance || float32 || This is result for Y from the formula above.
|-
| Min X || float32 || Min X of the navmesh.
|-
| Min Y || float32 || Min Y of the navmesh.
|-
| Min Z || float32 || Min Z of the navmesh.
|-
| Max X || float32 || Max X of the navmesh.
|-
| Max Y || float32 || Max Y of the navmesh.
|-
| Max Z || float32 || Max Z of the navmesh.
|-
| Triangles || sint16[num] || rowspan=2 | This actually behaves more like a dynamic array of triangle index structures. With each structure consisting of an array of triangle indexes.

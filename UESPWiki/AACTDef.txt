AACT records hold information about '''Actions'''.  The only known use of them at the moment is as the root of [[Tes5Mod:Mod_File_Format/IDLE|IDLE]] record trees.

They may be similar functionality to keywords attached to objects by the engine since some of these "idle" animations check for attacking or similar without any obvious means to actually activate such activity.

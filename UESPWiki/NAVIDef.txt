:Pattern 1 
::It begins with an integer, I suspect it's the amount of Navigation Mesh Groups
:Pattern 2 
::There is an integer of 00 00 00 01 and it is followed by one NAVM Entry.  This seems to be an end or transition point.
:Pattern 3
::There is an integer of greater then one that indicates the number of NAVM references that follow it.  This appears to be the start of a Nav Mesh Group

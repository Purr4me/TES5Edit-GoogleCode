- [TES5] Fixed error when copying VMAD scripts using drag & drop
- issue 104 : Files others than esp and esm (and ghost) are timestamped.
- issue  88 : Delete from the view pane column title contextual menu is disabled (due to a hard to reproduce bug). This is a workaround, not a fix.
- issue 119 : [TES5] The CK adds useless XLRL records when reverting a change. Those XLRL are considered benign and the record ITM.
- issue 110 : Check for errors now checks for invalid FormIDs. Also, new "Check for errors" sample script.
- Options are processed when they matter, not at the beginning.
- issue  82 : [TES5] Capitalization fixed in text are being treated as dirty edits. Description fields are case sensitive now.

Fixes:

- issue 107 : Copying a quest record causes extraneous script fragment data to be generated. Sizing and memory allocation issue.
- issue 106 : Error adding a new master to plugin with own navmeshes. Fire Union decider when they can effectively properly work, not before.

- issue 100 : Voice Type EditorID disappears. Memory sizing issue.
Known issue:
- issue 123 : Using Check for errors after sort master, before saving and reloading: the Cell FormID will not be updated. (that is a display issue only).
- issue 102 : Objects with property names but no assigned values don't display the names. The CK does not save the property name in the plugin in that case so it is correct.

- issue 115 : "Backup plugin" checkbox anchored to bottom of form.
- avoid firing some cached exception (to ease debugging).

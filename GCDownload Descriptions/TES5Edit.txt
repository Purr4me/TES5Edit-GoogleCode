TES5Edit 3.0.30 EXPERIMENTAL by ElminsterAU
Updated for Skyrim by HuguesLePors, Zilav and Sharlikran.

This is the ninth update of TES5Edit and is still being updated.  The current version provides support for Dragonborn DLC, improved routines for cleaning Master Files and Plugins, as well as better VMAD support.  However, it should still be considered experimental.  Make backups of your plugins and report any issues in the official Bethesda thread.  If you have never used TES5Edit, Wiki Pages and basic videos are available.

We need to remind you that we only support version 1.9 of Skyrim and version 3.0.30 of TES5Edit.  Update TES5Edit and Skyrim before you post in the forum.

Important DirectX Information:

If you get an error about d3dx9_*.dll not being installed, you need to update your DirectX to the most current version.  The most current (March 2008) version can be found here: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35 DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer or here: DirectX End-User Runtimes Redistributable (make sure to install it after unpacking it).  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23611

Future of TES5Edit:

We appreciate all the thanks and support from the community.  HuguesLePors recently volunteered and was responsible for the additional updates to the VMAD routines.  Although they look good please keep backups of your plugins and report any errors with VMAD.  Zilav has some updates planed that will improve the Check for Errors routine so that it includes checking for assets.  The additional function will check for meshes, textures, pex scripts, seq files (if needed), and will search BSA files as well.  This will help end users check to see if all required assets are present.  When files are missing especially scripts, that can lead to undetected issues, malfunctions with the plugin, and CTDs.

Although we welcome suggestions for improving TES5Edit automation is not one of them.  We do not plan on adding an automated way to clean multiple plugins or access to TES5Edit from the command line.  Currently cleaning a plugin involves indexing over a million references at times.  When only the required plugins are loaded then the cleaning is accurate.  If unnecessary plugins are involved those become part of the index and could cause the plugin to lose important and required data.  We understand the need for unattended automation at times.  However, without human intervention too many issues during the cleaning process would go unnoticed and make troubleshooting game issues related to plugins even more difficult then it already is.

As TES5Edit becomes more widely used in the Skyrim community it has become a concern that many people want to use the utility in place of the Construction Kit.  This is still not recommended.  We work hard to make TES5Edit as accurate as possible but development is directly related to the plugins themselves.  TES5Edit can not replicate all the changes that the CK will make.  Attack Data is the best example.  Merely checking or unchecking certain things for an NPC will alter the attack data dramatically.  We won't be adding those types of things to TES5Edit.  Please understand that we don't directly support the use of TES5Edit when it is used outside the scope of its design which is conflict resolution.  Editing masses of entries, merging plugins, and creating compatibility patches for Skyrim overhauls may be possible.  However, please create your own separate thread apart from the official Bethesda developmental thread for TES5Edit.

Trouble shooting plugins:

Detecting issues with plugins is a big concern.  Nobody wants to start their game over due to constant crashes to desktop.  Detecting issues with plugins is very difficult and is unique depending on the other plugins in your load order.  Recently I had two plugins that I felt were not related to the cause of my own crash to desktop while in the character creation menu.  However, after uninstalling those plugins I was able to create a new character and experience uninterrupted game play.  I know many of you look to the TES5Edit development team for guidance but we are not modders.  We rarely use the Construction Kit unless we need to test the data in the records of the plugins.  As noted by FlaFlada (slightly revised) who posted on my YouTube channel: The main points if having issues are 1. Dirty mods. 2. Leveled list issues. 3. Improper mod placement.  The solutions are 1.Clean all mods except Skyrim.esm and Unofficial patches using TES5Edit. 2. Let BOSS sort your mods. 3. make a bashed patch using Wrye Bash.  And in this order: Update mods, activate plugins, BOSS sort mods, clean mods, create patches with TES5Edit, delete duplicate records in any user created patches already handled by Wrye Bash, drag bashed patch BELOW additional user created patches, rebuild Bash Patch. If issues persist contact mod makers.

Contacting the mod authors is probably the last thing you should do after encountering an issue.  Unfortunately it's the first thing most people do.  As authors of TES5Edit we understand that there may be a lot of information to absorb for new users but give it time.  It took us time to inform ourselves about everything so you can't expect to understand it in a day.  I myself still look to the community and modders for advice and information to make sure I provide the most accurate guidance and information.  Telling us or a mod author that you can't read walls of text you can't comprehend doesn't help you at all when asking for help.  Most authors don't have the time to compile compatibility lists of plugins and list in detail how to manage your load order.  Questions like, "Is this updated for Skyrim 1.8?", "Is this compatible with [Insert Plugin Here]?", are easily answered by reading the documentation (if provided) or reading the description page.  I myself will be referring people more and more to community based resources, videos, and documentation so that I can work more directly with improving TES5Edit, updating Wrye Bash, updating plugins for Skyrim, and helping the BOSS team when possible.  For that reason I will be increasingly less understanding when it comes to questions that have been asked and answered before.

Previous versions such as FO3Edit, FNVEdit, TES4Edit:

We understand that sometimes updates to programs break things.  Please use the updates with caution.  However, please use them and then report issues so we can improve the program.  Our goal is to make all versions as bug free as possible and introduce new features that are useful for the modding community for all the Bethesda games this utility supports.

TES5Edit Updates:

With each new version of TES5Edit it is STRONGLY recommended to restore plugins from backups and reclean them. Otherwise any fixes and updates to cleaning process won't take effect.

- "Jump to" option in record's header popup menu.
- Enable/disable autosaves in options.
- Log file is overwritten at 3MB.
- [xDump] Fatal exceptions are reported through ReportProgress to have a timestamp. It might be useful to track down the issue.

- [TES5] Fixed error when copying VMAD scripts using drag & drop
- issue 104 : Files others than esp and esm (and ghost) are timestamped.
- issue  88 : Delete from the view pane column title contextual menu is disabled (due to a hard to reproduce bug). This is a workaround, not a fix.
- issue 119 : [TES5] The CK adds useless XLRL records when reverting a change. Those XLRL are considered benign and the record ITM.
- issue 110 : Check for errors now checks for invalid FormIDs. Also, new "Check for errors" sample script.
- Options are processed when they matter, not at the beginning.
- issue  82 : [TES5] Capitalization fixed in text are being treated as dirty edits. Description fields are case sensitive now.
Scripting:

- New sample scripts.
Fixes:
- Compare to will not overwrite an existing file, nor will it leave temporary files behind.

- issue 107 : Copying a quest record causes extraneous script fragment data to be generated. Sizing and memory allocation issue.
- issue 106 : Error adding a new master to plugin with own navmeshes. Fire Union decider when they can effectively properly work, not before.
- issue 105 : Overwriting quest fragments or Quest Aliases may produce exceptions. During copy, memory is initialized properly before being used.
- issue 100 : Voice Type EditorID disappears. Memory sizing issue.
Known issue:
- issue 123 : Using Check for errors after sort master, before saving and reloading: the Cell FormID will not be updated. (that is a display issue only).
- issue 102 : Objects with property names but no assigned values don't display the names. The CK does not save the property name in the plugin in that case so it is correct.
Misc:
- issue 115 : "Backup plugin" checkbox anchored to bottom of form.
- avoid firing some cached exception (to ease debugging).

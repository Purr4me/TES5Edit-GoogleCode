This is a general list of major features roughly organized into categories. Not 
all minor features are listed.


  General
---------------------------------------
	- Standard multiple document interface (MDI) allows editting of several plugins at
	  the same time.
	- More gracefully handling of errors (missing IDs, files, etc...) rather than simply
	  terminating.  The current version simply ignores most errors.
	- All master files are only loaded once per session which means much faster load
	  times after the first time. Currently you must exit the application to clear the
	  master data if required.
	- Load times are much faster than the TESCS (roughly half). This doesn't include 
	  the fact that all master files are only loaded once per session.
	- Records can be permanently 'cleaned' from the active plugin easily. This includes
	  INFO records and cell reference sub-records.
	- Edit records by double-clicking in all lists (NPC inventory, containers, levelled
	  lists, etc...).  
	- Toggle viewing of only modified items.
	- Copy or rename most record types.
	- Option to backup plugin on save (PLUGIN.ESP.001, PLUGIN.ESP.002, etc...).
	- Standard 'Save As' file menu added to change the saved plugin filename.
	- Records can be dragged in many situations to copy that record (for instance to/from
	  cell reference lists, containers, levelled lists, inventories) or between
	  different plugins.
	- Find a text string in all records. You can double-click a record in the result
	  list to edit that record. The last ten searches are saved.
	- Display all objects that use a particular record (like the Info comment in TESCS).
	  Compiled scripts and dialog results are included in the search.
	- New icons for all item types.
	- Set a default author name for all new plugins.
	- Export/import items to standard CSV files.
	- View exactly where a record is used in the currently loaded records. Find object
	  references in dialogue results and scripts.


   Load Plugins
---------------------------------------
	- Extended load dialog with a sortable list showing the plugin name, type, and
	  last modification date. This makes it much easier to find the plugin you want.
	- Displays ESS save games in the file list.
	- Load progress display.
	- Load plugins from a custom game directory.


   Main View
---------------------------------------
	- Item tab control has been changed into a list. This makes viewing a certain
	  item type easier.
	- Almost all item types are viewed and editted in the list view (such as
	  scripts, globals, etc...).
	- Each item in a plugin will have one edit window open at a time (unlike the
	  TESCS where you can open multiple windows for a single item).
	- Consistent design of the item windows.
	- Color coding of active (green) and deleted (red) records in all lists. 
	- Records can be sorted by their modified/delete status in all lists.
	- The sort field and column widths for each item type is saved and restored
	  when you leave and return to that item type. 


   Dialogue
---------------------------------------
	- Copy and rename dialogue topics, including all the child INFOs.
	- Change position of a dialogue responses Up/Down in the list.
	- Copy dialogue responses (within a dialogue).
	- Display of INFO function values in the dialogue list.  Values display not 
	  only the function/ID for the function, but also the value compared against
	  allowing one to quickly gather more information at a quick glance. 
	- Resizable dialogue and info windows. 
	- Using the standard cancel button in the dialogue window cancels all changes
	  to INFOs of the dialogue. 


   Script
---------------------------------------
	- Color coding of script code. Use a default white or blue color scheme or use
	  any custom colors to identify the various word types. Can also be disabled.
	- Select the font used in the script window.
	- New script compiler reports many more errors and possible errors.
	- Three levels of warning/error messages (weak, default, and strong) allowing you
	  to set how many compiler messages are recorded.
	- Compiler adds spaces to the script output where they might be required or
	  expected (such as in if statements).
	- Object types used in functions are checked more rigourously. If the function
	  expects an NPC ID, you'll receive an error/warning if you use another type.
	- Compiles script on save automatically (no warrning/errors displayed).
	- Export and import scripts to/from text files.
	- View detailed help on all script functions.
	- All compiler errors/warnings are displayed in a splitter pane at the bottom of
	  the script window. Double-click a message to jump to the location of the message.
	- View detailed information on compiler messages and display the function help if
	  the message is related to a specific function.
	- Compiler does not permit the use of reserved words as local variables (such as
	  end, X, Y, etc...).
	- Functions that are known to be broken will result in a compiler message.	  
	- Simple function tooltips can be displayed for faster scripting.
	- Define custom functions, such as MWSE or MWE functions, in an external data 
	  file (CustomFunctions.dat) which can then be used and compiled in the editor.
	  Includes all current MWSE (v0.9.2a) and MWE functions.
	- Use an external plugin file (MwExtraFile.esp by default) to define extra records,
	  such as 'player', in order to compile scripts without needing to load its
	  master files.
	- Compile using original, Bloodmoon, or Tribunal function sets.
	- Automatically indent scripts.


   Other Items
---------------------------------------
	- Easier editing of item counts in Containers and Levelled Lists (use +/- to modify
	  the count as well as the regular edit). Supports the selection of multiple items.
	- When an object ID changes when editting a record, you have the option to 
	  Rename, Copy, or Cancel.

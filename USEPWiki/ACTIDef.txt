{{Trail|File Formats|Mod File Format}}
ACTI records contain information on "activators", which seem to be of 2 main types:
*Actual objects with models (and/or destruction information)
*Simple triggers with nothing more than a name and [[Tes5Mod:Mod File Format/VMAD_Field|VMAD]] information.

This seems to be an older alternative to FLOR/TREE as most of the harvestables are in those 2 record types but there are several functional types here as well such as Nirnroot.

ACTI flags are held in the record header.

NavMesh Import Options (the following are mutually exclusive)
*0x00000000 : Collision Geometry. (Dafault) When selected there is no independent flag for it.
*0x03000000 : Filter
*0x08000000 : Bounding Box
*0x40000000 : Ground

Flags not related to the NavMesh
*0x00000040 : Has Tree LOD
*0x00000100 : Must Update Anims
*0x00000200 : Hidden from Local Map. When selected in the CK it turns the flag Off in the headder.  Therefore it is Hidden
*0x00010000 : Random Animation Start
*0x00020000 : Dangerous. Automatically set when Ignore Object Interaction.  Otherwise it can not be set independently.
*0x00100000 : Ignore Object Interaction. Sets Dangerous Automatically.
*0x00800000 : Is Marker
*0x02000000 : Obstacle
*0x20000000 : Child Can Use
*?x???????? : Has Platform/Language Specific Textures. I have never seen this set in Skyrim or Update.esm in the English version.

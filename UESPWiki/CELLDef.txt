Fields XLCN through XEZN do not always appear in that order in Skyrim.esm.

The last four bytes in XCLC do not appear to be a form ID. The following values appear 100 or more times in those last four bytes:
{|class="wikitable"
! Count
! Value

| 100 || 53bd00

| 279 || 53ba00

The less frequent values show a distribution of values that makes them look like a bitmap.

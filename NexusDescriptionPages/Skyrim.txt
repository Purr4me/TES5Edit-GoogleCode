[color=#00BFFF]TES5Edit 3.0.31 EXPERIMENTAL by ElminsterAU. Updated for Skyrim by Hlp, Zilav and Sharlikran.[/color]

[color=#FF0000]This is the tenth update of TES5Edit and is still being updated.  However, it should still be considered experimental.  Make backups of your plugins and report any issues in the official Bethesda thread.  If you have never used TES5Edit, Wiki Pages and basic videos are available.

We only support version 1.9 of Skyrim and version 3.0.31 of TES5Edit.  Update TES5Edit and Skyrim before you post in the forum.[/color]

[color=#00BFFF]Future of TES5Edit:[/color]

We appreciate all the thanks and support from the community.  Zilav's and Hlp's ongoing contributions to the project are greatly appreciated.  In the latest version of TES5Edit Zilav has introduced the Asset Browser and Asset Manager.  While we appreciate feedback and enhancement ideas please be understanding that these two new additions are in their early stages.  Your patience is appreciated while they are updated and refined to provide more useful and accurate functionality.

The Asset Manager function will check for the presence of meshes, textures, pex scripts, seq files (if needed), and will search BSA files as well.  This will help end users check to see if all required assets are present.  When files are missing such as scripts, meshes and textures, those missing files can lead to undetected issues, malfunctions with the plugin, and CTDs.  You may come across missing files and when that happens you should contact the author of the plugin.  When doing so please be extremely considerate because in the early stage of the Asset Manager's development it sometimes reports erroneous errors.  This should change with future updates.

The Asset Manager also allows you to copy all the files used by the mod to a new folder for archiving and uploading to the Nexus.  The function only copies loose files and does not make a BSA file at this time.  You will quickly discover that it copies many files that are already included with Skyrim's own DLC inside the official BSA files.  The function also copies only files and pathes directly encoded in the plugin.  Things like custom voices for NPCs and "filename_0.nif" zero slider meshes are not copied at this time.  When using this feature I suggest using a program like BeyondCompare to compare the destination folder where TES5Edit put the files and the original folder for your mod.  Comparing the contents and ruling out unneeded files will take practice but in the end will help ensure your mod has all the needed and updated resources for your mod.

I have not had much time to play with the Asset Browser yet and I'm sorry I can't provide a better description.

[color=#00BFFF]Cleaning Plugins and official DLC:[/color]

I am still seeing many posts where people state that they have cleaned multiple plugins at the same time.  I understand that the cleaning process seems tedious and it would be nice to fire off the program to clean 200 plugins while you go do something else.  Unfortunately there are still no plans on adding an automated way to clean multiple plugins or access to TES5Edit from the command line.  Being there to see what errors might be reported during the cleaning process ensure that you are aware of potential issues that can lead to instability while playing Skyrim.

Cleaning multiple plugins at once can and will lead to erroneous cleaning and can in many cases lead to unwanted crashes to the desktop.  Please look at the Cleaning Tutorial or watch the cleaning videos.  They show both loading the plugins you know are required or show only loading the one plugin and letting TES5Edit load any other dependencies.  After applying the filter for cleaning, clean only the one plugin.  It is imperative that the process is repeated for each individual separate plugin that you wish to clean.  

Currently cleaning a plugin involves indexing over a million references at times.  When only the required plugins are loaded then the cleaning is accurate.  If unnecessary plugins are involved those become part of the index and could cause the plugin to lose important and required data.  Without human intervention too many issues during the cleaning process would go unnoticed and make troubleshooting game issues related to plugins even more difficult then it already is.

[color=#00BFFF]Cleaning Plugins and official DLC when a new version of TES5Edit is released:[/color]

It is not always necessary to clean all your plugins every time a new version of TES5Edit is released.  More often then not an ITM does not cause Skyrim to crash.  What can lead to crashes are deleted references which are resolved as part of the cleaning process when you choose "Undelete and Disable References".  It is still important to remove "Identical to Master" records for a more stable game but not as vital to eliminating crashes.  The other causes for crashes are corrupt plugins, poorly written and managed scripts, and missing files required by the plugin.  If Skyrim is working for you leave things the way they are.  It's not really required unless we make some major update in the cleaning process.  If you feel you must clean the official Bethesda ESM files then restore any backups you have.  However, it is much more reliable to use the Verify Cache feature from Steam.  

[color=#00BFFF]Using TES5Edit in place of the CK:[/color]

As TES5Edit becomes more widely used in the Skyrim community it has become a concern that many people still want to use the utility in place of the Construction Kit.  This is still not recommended.  We work hard to make TES5Edit as accurate as possible but development is directly related to the plugins themselves.  TES5Edit can not replicate all the changes that the CK will make.  Attack Data is the best example.  Merely checking or unchecking certain things for an NPC will alter the attack data dramatically.  We won't be adding those types of things to TES5Edit.  Please understand that we don't directly support the use of TES5Edit when it is used outside the scope of its design which is conflict resolution.  

[color=#00BFFF]Merging Plugins:[/color]

There is still a demand for merging multiple plugins but merging plugins is still unsupported directly from TES5Edit's UI.  There is a [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37981]TES5Edit script by Matortheeternal[/url] for merging plugins.  Some mods cannot be successfully merged with it and you should direct all questions relating to the script to the author.  There is [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?showtopic=1033740]a thread available[/url] where people have posted which plugins merge successfully or unsuccessfully.  For more info on ways to use TES5Edit to Merge Plugins check out [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/904953-how-to-merge-multiple-mods-with-multiple-master-files]How To Merge Multiple Mods With Multiple Master Files[/url] and [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1425724-merging-mods]Merging Mods[/url].  Otherwise if you intend on editing masses of entries, merging plugins, and creating compatibility patches for Skyrim overhauls please create your own separate thread.

[color=#00BFFF]Trouble shooting plugins:[/color]

Detecting issues with plugins is a big concern.  Nobody wants to start their game over due to constant crashes to desktop.  Detecting issues with plugins is very difficult and is unique depending on the other plugins in your load order.  Many people still forget to look for log files from TES5Edit or load the plugins into the the Construction Kit and look at EditorWarnings.txt.  Paying attention to log files will help you understand the cause of the issue and sometimes lead to a quick and easy resolution.  Although some errors from the Construction Kit are erroneous and can be ignored some should defiantly not be ignored.  Get used to reading the files and looking for problems with mods.

It is still rather common for people to simply post, "my game crashes, what gives."  That is still completely useless in troubleshooting your issue.  When you experience crashes you should be disabling and reactivating plugins until the game no longer crashes.  Then report your issue to the author of the plugin.  Although I have directed people to the [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/forum/421-skyrim-mod-troubleshooting]Skyrim mod troubleshooting[/url] forum in the past it is also not the place to post, "Here is my load order, my game crashes, please help!"  Again you need to do some troubleshooting on your own and provide specific information when asking for help.

I know many of you look to the TES5Edit development team for guidance but we are not modders.  We rarely use the Construction Kit unless we need to test the data in the records of the plugins.  As noted by FlaFlada a while back who posted (slightly revised) on my YouTube channel: The main points if having issues are 1. Dirty mods. 2. Leveled list issues. 3. Improper mod placement.  The solutions are 1. Clean all mods except Skyrim.esm and Unofficial patches using TES5Edit. 2. Let BOSS sort your mods. 3. Make a bashed patch using Wrye Bash.  And in this order: Update mods, activate plugins, BOSS sort mods, clean mods, create patches with TES5Edit, delete duplicate records in any user created patches already handled by Wrye Bash, drag bashed patch BELOW additional user created patches, rebuild Bash Patch. If issues persist contact mod makers.

Contacting the mod authors is probably the last thing you should do after encountering an issue.  Unfortunately it's the first thing most people do.  As authors of TES5Edit we understand that there may be a lot of information to absorb for new users but give it time.  It took us time to inform ourselves about everything so you can't expect to understand it in a day.  I myself still look to the community and modders for advice and information to make sure I provide the most accurate guidance and information.  Telling us or a mod author that you can't read walls of text you can't comprehend doesn't help you at all when asking for help.  Most authors don't have the time to compile compatibility lists of plugins and list in detail how to manage your load order.  Questions like, "Is this updated for Skyrim 1.8?", "Is this compatible with [Insert Plugin Here]?", are easily answered by reading the documentation (if provided) or reading the description page.  I myself will be referring people more and more to community based resources, videos, and documentation so that I can work more directly with improving TES5Edit, updating Wrye Bash, updating plugins for Skyrim, and helping the BOSS team when possible.  For that reason I will be increasingly less understanding when it comes to questions that have been asked and answered before.

[color=#00BFFF]Previous versions such as FO3Edit, FNVEdit, TES4Edit:[/color]

We understand that sometimes updates to programs break things.  Please use the updates with caution.  However, please use them and then report issues so we can improve the program.  Our goal is to make all versions as bug free as possible and introduce new features that are useful for the modding community for all the Bethesda games this utility supports.

- Saving messages to [TES5/FNV/FO3/TES4]Edit_log.txt upon exit.
- Fixed minor bug when Edit can't find game's folder. If your registry settings is invalid due to a Steam bug and Edit is unable to find your game, put it in the game's root folder where the game executable file is (Oblivion.exe, TESV.exe, etc).
- Reason: The game's Registry entry is missing. This happens to a lot of people, because Steam likes to remove it whenever the game is updated or its game cache is verified. Run the game's launcher to add the Registry entry back again.

[size=4][color=#FF8C00]FAQ:[/color][/size]

Q: I have the following errors with one of my plugins what do I do?

[00:43] Background Loader: Error: record ARMA contains unexpected (or out of order) subrecord MODL
[00:43] Background Loader: Errors were found in: ShieldofYsgramorDraugrAA [ARMA:01001001]
[00:43] Background Loader: Contained subrecords: EDID BODT RNAM DNAM MOD2 MO2T MOD3 MO3T MOD4 MO4T MOD5 MO5T SNDD NAM0 NAM1 NAM2 NAM3 MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL 

A: I have seen that occur with plugins made with the ReProccer, NPC Editor, and older buggy versions of TESVSnip.  Usually TESVSnip 4.2 or 4.3.x.  TESVSnip never used the proper compression which is ZLib so the files are improperly compressed or they were left uncompressed.  No matter how the plugin was made it will cause issues durring game play.  You can either continue to use them but they may cause game instability, report the errors to the author so they can be addressed, or uninstall them.

ToDo List:

Update Miax’s Tome of FO3Edit to be TES5Edit's documentation.
Update NAVM, NAVI, and their subrecords.

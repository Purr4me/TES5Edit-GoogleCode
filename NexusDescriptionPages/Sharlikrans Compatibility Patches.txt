Check out the new banners that [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/69377]Grace Darkling[/url] made for me.  That was a sweet and appreciated Christmas Gift.  I added a few in game Christmas shots of my own.

[size=4][color=#FF8C00]After installation : Troubleshooting : FormID Changes : CTDs:[/color][/size]
[color=#FF0000]If you are experiencing any CTDs after installing the compatibility patch it's because some of the FromIDs were 00000000 and needed to be changed, or I changed it in the process for other reasons, or the CK striped out information no longer needed.  Also if you use a mod that has one of my patches as a Master File, then the FormIDs will be different in my patch then in the original file and that might cause a crash as well.

I recommend using the old mod until you choose to make a new character.  If you use the patch with a new char then there won't be any of the old FormIDs referenced in the save game from the original plugin.[/color]

Aside from the compatibility patches here are some videos that can help you understand more about preparing your game and reducing potential issues.  I also have two on installing Wrye Bash and BOSS.

[size=4][color=#FF8C00]Overview:[/color][/size]

These are files I have used in the past that are now updated and cleaned with TES5Edit.  Some files require the original authors mods.  To install simply install the esp over the original authors mod to use.  If you use NMM when prompted to overwrite choose yes.

I will update various mods as time permits.  These are not simply loaded into the CK and then saved.  Any information the CK does not like, such as out of order subrecords may be striped out of the mod once you save it.  So that is not the best way to resolve issues with plugins and just creates more incompatibility with other mods and potential CTDs.

I am also doing this to learn more about the process.  Decoding records is one thing but learning the CK and it's caveats is another entirely.  Most of the files are only fixed, no updates were made unless it was required or improved functionality.

[size=4][color=#FF8C00]Requests:[/color][/size]

Thanks for all the kind words I am glad to hear that for some this is really relieving some CTDs.  You guys are welcome.  

I want to include other mods that might need some kind of repair.  I'm pretty busy so I want to be sure if you do ask me to look at something that you load the mod into TES5Edit first.  The first requirement is, was the mod posted before Feb 07 2012, if so then that's one thing to consider since more than likely it was never loaded into the CK.  The second thing is when you look at the message pane in TES5Edit does it say there are out of order or unexpected records, if so then that's also a good candidate because it was probably made with TESVSnip.

A mod does not have to fit both situations.  If there is a mod that fits either of those situations, let me know and I can take a look at it on my days off.  There will be times though that a Pre-CK mod is totally fine, so it may not require anything.  I am more than happy to try to fix up some plugins and post them so others can benefit from using them as well.

TES5Edit will complain about the VMAD in an EXPL record, just ignore that.  I have not found a suitable replacement yet.

Version 3 no longer requires the original mod, and the Eyepatch is  properly assigned to slot 55 as mentioned in the [url=http://www.creationkit.com/Biped_Object]CK Wiki[/url].  Now you can use the patch with a hood for example.  They are still available in both Clothing and Light Armor and, can be purchased from Grelka in Riften.

[size=4][color=#FF8C00]Looking for Help with Dovahkiin Hideout:[/color][/size]

I am looking for people who have knowledge with Dialogue, Quests, and voice overs for NPCs.  One of my biggest projects that will be the most difficult is fixing Dovahkiin Hideout.  I may have worked on the update for TES5Edit and I know the technical aspects of records and how many bytes some of the subrecords have, but I am new to modding and I could use the help on that mod.  There is another that has some issues I want to fix but it's probably due to oversights more then being pre ck and potentially made with snip.

Update: He made some changes and after doing so I tweaked the files a bit.  I sent him two versions (01/2013) and one is specifically for Hearthfires.  There will need to be more work done to get the NPCs talking again and the PACK and AI needs to be reworked.  Hopefully I can learn how or he will have a little spare time to do it.

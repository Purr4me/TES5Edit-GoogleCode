{{TOCright}} '''PACK''' records describe AI packages, which are used to control the behavior and activities of NPCs.

PACK records use a moderately complex structure, with various fields that occur multiple times and have different meanings depending upon where they occur within the overall structure.  The records also seem to generally contain a large amount of unnecessary and/or obsolete content -- deleted activities never seem to actually be deleted from the game data; some sections are required even though they are entirely empty in 99.9% of the PACK records.  As a result, a large fraction of the data in a given PACK record may not be visible in the CK editor.

== Header ==
These fields are always found at the start of the PACK record.

== Public Package Data ==
The section providing the public package data is located after the fields listed for the [[#Header|header]], and extends until an XNAM field is encountered.  It provides a list of activities and parameters controlling those activities, all of which are listed in the "Public Package Data" section of the CK edit interface.

The section is made up of a series of ANAM fields, each of which is followed by various other fields providing the activity parameters corresponding to that ANAM field.  Then the section contains a series of UNAM fields, each of which provides the activity name corresponding to one of the previous ANAM fields.

Note that ANAM fields are also found in the [[#Procedure Tree|Procedure Tree]] section, if one exists.

|- 
| * || ANAM || Activity Type || zstring || A string identifying the type of data stored in this activity entry.  Each ANAM field is followed by one field that provides data with the given type.  Possible values in this section, and the associated field, are:
* Bool: CNAM field, CNAM type=uint8
* Float: CNAM field, CNAM type=float
* Int: CNAM field, CNAM type=int32
* Location: PLDT field
* ObjectList: CNAM field, CNAM type=float
* SingleRef: PTDA field
* TargetSelector: PTDA field
* Topic: PDTO field ''or'' TPIC field (only one instance of a TPIC field)
One and only one of the following fields is found after each ANAM field.  (Other values for ANAM are only found in the Procedure Tree section of the record.)
|-
| -
|
:CNAM
| Numeric Value || variable || CNAM is 1-4 bytes in size, and the type of data in CNAM depends upon the previous ANAM field; see above.

|-
| * || UNAM || Activity ID || uint8
|Each UNAM field provides a numerical ID; that ID can be looked up in the Package Template to determine the Name of the activity as listed in the CK.

Although the UNAM fields are listed after all of the ANAM fields for this section, each UNAM field provides the name for one of the previous ANAM fields.  The first UNAM field corresponds to the first ANAM field, etc.
|-
| + || XNAM || ''Unknown'' || int8 || Number ranging from -77 to 99.  There is always one XNAM field in a PACK record, and it is always located at the end of the Public Package Data section.
|}

== Procedure Tree ==
This section is the first of two sections that are only found in template packages.  This section defines the structure of the procedure tree used by this template and all packages based upon this template.

As with the [[#Public Package Data|Public Package Data]] section, this section is also made up of a series of ANAM fields.  However, a completely different set of ANAM values appear in this section, and each ANAM section contains multiple fields, all of which are different than those found in Public Package Data.

This section ends when a UNAM field is found, signaling the start of the [[#Procedure Data|Procedure Data]] section.

! width="12%" | [[Tes5Mod:File Format Conventions|Type/Size]]
! | Info
|- 
| * || ANAM || Branch Type || zstring || A string identifying the type of branch data stored in the following section.  Possible values found in this section are:
* Procedure: Basic element of the tree (only non-branch element).  All individual activities (PKC2 fields) are contained with Procedures.
* Random: Top-level branch that can contain multiple Procedures.
* Sequence: Top-level branch that can contain multiple Procedures.
* Simultaneous: Top-level branch that can contain multiple Procedures.
* Stacked: Top-level branch that can contain multiple Procedures.
Each ANAM entry is followed by multiple fields.  The count column for the following entries is relative to a given ANAM field -- overall these fields can always occur 0 or many times in a given record.
|-
| + ||
:CITC
| Condition Count || uint32 || Number of conditions (CTDA fields) in this branch.  Can be 0, in which case there are no CTDA fields.
|-
| * ||
:[[Tes5Mod:Mod File Format/CTDA Field|CTDA]]
| Conditions || struct[32] || Conditions controlling when this branch can be active.  Note that conditions relevant to the overall package are provided using CTDA fields that appear in the [[#Header|header]] section.
|-
| - ||
:PRCB
| ''Unknown'' || struct[8] || Appears to be two uint32 values
|-
| - ||
:PNAM 
| Procedure Type || zstring || Note that PNAM fields also appear in the Procedure Data Section, in which case formats other than zstring are possible
|-
| - ||
:FNAM
| Flag || uint32 || Flag.  Only one bit is in use:
:0x01=Success Completes Package
|-
| * ||
:PKC2
| Activity ID || uint8 || The PKC2 fields provide a list of all the activity IDs found in this branch.  Note that a given activity ID can occur multiple times within the Procedure Tree Section, in particular if that activity is part of multiple branches.
|-
| - ||
:PFO2
| ''Unknown'' || struct[16] ||
|-
| - ||
:PFOR
| ''Unknown'' || struct[12] ||
|}

== Procedure Data ==
This section is also only found in template packages.  It provides the name associated with each activity ID.  It consists of a series of UNAM fields, each followed by one BNAM field and one PNAM field.

! width="3%" | [[Tes5Mod:File Format Conventions|C]]
! width="10%" | SubRecord
! width="15%" | Name
! width="12%" | [[Tes5Mod:File Format Conventions|Type/Size]]
! | Info
|- 
| * || UNAM || Activity ID || uint8 || This is the same activity ID provided in both the [[#Public Package Data|Public Package Data]] and [[#Procedure Tree|Procedure Tree]] sections.  However, many additional activity IDs can also possibly appear; any additional IDs correspond to activities that were deleted from the package and are no longer accessible through the CK edit interface.
|-
| + ||
:BNAM
| Activity Name || zstring || The activity name as displayed in the CK
|-
| + ||
:PNAM
| ''Unknown'' || uint32 || Probably a flag: only values are 0 or 1.  Note that the PNAM fields also appear in the Procedure Tree section, but have a completely different format and meaning.
|}

== Begin/End/Change ==
This section provides the 'On Begin', 'On End', and 'On Change' actions for this package.  It is always present at the end of all PACK records (for both standard packages and template packages -- even though the CK editor does not display this section for template packages).

It consists of three marker fields (POBA, POEA, POCA), each of which is always followed by an INAM and a PDTO field.  Each marker may also be followed by a SCHR, SCDA, SCTX, and/or TNAM field.
Always contains (although SCHR fields are optional)

[color=#00BFFF]TES5Edit Updates:[/color]

[color=#FF0000]With each new version of TES5Edit you may want to restore plugins from backups and reclean them. Otherwise any fixes and updates to cleaning process won't take effect.[/color]

[color=#00BFFF]Version 3.0.29 contains the following changes:[/color]

- [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/921884-icons-for-tes5edit/]New Icon[/url] provided by moiman100.
- [TES5] more information is decoded (Records ARMA, NVSI, MOD2, LVLO).
- [TES5] Every string value gets own ID when localizing plugin
- [TES5] Fixed error when copying VMAD scripts using drag & drop
- issue 104 : Files others than esp and esm (and ghost) are timestamped.
- issue  88 : Delete from the view pane column title contextual menu is disabled (due to a hard to reproduce bug). This is a workaround, not a fix.
- issue 119 : [TES5] The CK adds useless XLRL records when reverting a change. Those XLRL are considered benign and the record ITM.
- issue 110 : Check for errors now checks for invalid FormIDs. Also, new "Check for errors" sample script.
- Options are processed when they matter, not at the beginning.
- issue  82 : [TES5] Capitalization fixed in text are being treated as dirty edits. Description fields are case sensitive now.
Scripting:
- Scripts can use other scripts with standard pascal "uses" keyword.
- New functions available.
- New sample scripts.
Fixes:
- Compare to will not overwrite an existing file, nor will it leave temporary files behind.
- issue 125 : Condition added are no longer empty.
- issue 121 : Changing FormID of Region causes severe bugs. Reference building is delayed to after the change is done. Non region reference XCLR record are no longer removed.
- issue 120/118 : Reference not updated while adding a master. Reference lookup during the addition was sometimes unreliable. 
- issue 117 : Bug in script Undelete and Disable References.pas 
- issue 112 : Option "Simple Record" malfunctioning.
- issue 111 : AV when saving subrecords with prefixed arrays. Sizing and memory allocation are done properly during every phase.
- issue 108 : Very slow saving after editing ESM flag. Background updating limited as much as possible during saves.
- issue 107 : Copying a quest record causes extraneous script fragment data to be generated. Sizing and memory allocation issue.
- issue 106 : Error adding a new master to plugin with own navmeshes. Fire Union decider when they can effectively properly work, not before.
- issue 105 : Overwriting quest fragments or Quest Aliases may produce exceptions. During copy, memory is initialized properly before being used.
- issue 100 : Voice Type EditorID disappears. Memory sizing issue.
Known issue:
- issue 123 : Using Check for errors after sort master, before saving and reloading: the Cell FormID will not be updated. (that is a display issue only).
- issue 102 : Objects with property names but no assigned values don't display the names. The CK does not save the property name in the plugin in that case so it is correct.
Misc:
- issue 115 : "Backup plugin" checkbox anchored to bottom of form.
- avoid firing some cached exception (to ease debugging).

Some additional tweaking needs to be done but we are close to having on open beta.  About 90-95% of the records are decoded at this time.  I have started to update the UESPWiki and I keep a current list on our site in the [url=http://code.google.com/p/skyrim-plugin-decoding-project/wiki/UESPWikiUpdates]UESPWikiUpdates[/url].

We would love to have more people helping out on the project.

[color="#FF8C00"][size="4"][b]Name:[/color][/size][/b] Skyrim Plugin Decoding Project

[color="#FF8C00"][size="4"][b]Summary:[/color][/size][/b] A collaborative project to decode Skyrim's record structure using TES5Dump and provide a working version of TES5Edit.

[color="#FF8C00"][size="4"][b]Description:[/color][/size][/b] TES5Dump (a.k.a. TES4Dump / FO3Dump / FNVDump) are utilities that dump the contents of a .esp or .esm plugin to a text file, using internal record definitions. By comparing its output with plugins of known contents, the record definitions can be tweaked until the correct structures have been decoded. TES5Dump also forms the plugin parsing backend for the TES5Edit utility. (a.k.a. TES4Edit / FO3Edit / FNVEdit)

Skyrim's record structure has not yet been fully decoded, and the Skyrim modding community suffers from the lack of a working TES5Edit.  This project's aim is to help the decoding effort by providing TES5Dump and allowing many people to update its definitions using Subversion, and to provide the TES5Edit utility. 

Its predecessors FNVEdit, FO3Edit, and TES4Edit by ElminsterAU are the best tools to use for exploring overlaps between mods and cleaning mods.  TES5Edit will have the same functionality since the compiled release will be made with the same TES4 back engine using the definitions as a result of this project.  He would work on it himself, but unfortunately suffers from a severe lack of spare time.  He has offered to compile TES5Edit after the necessary supporting files are changed for Skyrim's file format.   

This utility will let you easily see how multiple mods interact and override each other, as well as giving you a quick view of the changes that a plugin makes. It lets you browse a graphical record tree of your active plugins, revealing the values set by most record types and comparing overlapping changes from each active plugin.

When started it will automatically find your Skyrim Data directory. You then get a dialog to select which modules you want to load with the current selection from your plugins.txt as default value. Once you have confirmed that dialog the selected modules will start loading in the background.  The program will then work the same as its predecessors.

[color="#FF8C00"][size="4"][b]License:[/color][/size][/b] Mozilla Public License TES5Dump and TES5Edit.

Anyone is welcome to download the source to TES5Dump using the instructions below.

[color="#FF8C00"][size="4"][b]Why do we need TES5Dump:[/b][/size][/color]

[quote name='WrinklyNinja']
.snip. TES5Edit isn't the important thing in this scenario, what's important is getting the records decoded, because a whole load of things (Gecko, Bashed Patch, etc) require that, not just TES5Edit...[/quote]
[quote name='WrinklyNinja']
.snip. Because so much depends on the record decoding, it's sensible to open up the task to as many people as possible. As such, publicly hosting the definitions and the TES5Dump code/program is best for that. The plugin format has historically been documented at UESP.net for previous games, but I'm of the opinion that only verified decoded records should be documented there, so we still need a central location lots of people can read/write to. A SVN repository would be ideal...[/quote]

[color="#FF8C00"][size="4"][b]How TES5Dump works:[/b][/size][/color]

[quote name='ElminsterAU']
TES5Dump Is a command line utility that can take an esm/esp file, decode it, and give a human readable dump to the console. The output can be redirected to a file, so you could use:

TES5Dump Skyrim.esm > Skyrim.txt

To turn the whole master into a huge text file.

What works better when working on the record definitions is to create new .esp’s using the CK with just a single (or a few) records, of a single type, with specific values for all the different fields.

The process is then basically:
Create new .esp with example records
Run TES5Dump
Modify record definitions
Repeat till dump is correct
Repeat steps 2-4 until all possible record types and all possible fields are covered
[/quote]

[color="#FF8C00"][size="4"][b]What we need for this project:[/b][/size][/color]

We are looking for volunteers and TES enthusiasts who are willing to contribute their time in decoding Skyrim's files, and making updates to the UESP Wiki.

If you would like to participate in this project please send me a PM.

[color="#FF8C00"][size="3"][b]Wiki Updaters:[/b][/size][/color]

Any general knowledge of how to edit html and possibly xml.  After you have checked out the files the folder you will work with is UESPWiki.  It will contain templates of each record posted on UESPWiki.  To make changes to the [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes5Mod:Mod_File_Format]UESP Wiki[/url] site you need to register first.  Registration is free and hardly any information is required.

Please refer to the on site wiki: [url=http://code.google.com/p/skyrim-plugin-decoding-project/wiki/PostingToTheUESPWiki]PostingToTheUESPWiki[/url] 

[color="#FF8C00"][size="3"][b]Record Decoders:[/b][/size][/color]

After you have checked out the files the folder you will work with is TES5Dump.  The only file you need to edit will be wbDefinitionsTES5.pas.
To compile the source you need a trial version of Delphi found here.  [url=https://downloads.embarcadero.com/free/delphi]embarcadero.com[/url]  The source is written in Delphi but you only need a basic knowledge with C++ or Java to interpret the Delphi code and figure out the references.
Having knowledge of or, experience in decoding the records in plugins would be extremely helpful as well.  The decoding is not programming intensive because all you are really doing is updating the pre existing routines for Skyrim's format.

Please refer to the on site wiki: [url=http://code.google.com/p/skyrim-plugin-decoding-project/wiki/DecodingRecords]DecodingRecords[/url]

[color="#FF8C00"][size="4"][b]Getting Set Up:[/b][/size][/color]

You will need an SVN client like [url=http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html]TortoiseSVN[/url] to submit your changes.  Instructions are listed [url=https://code.google.com/p/skyrim-plugin-decoding-project/wiki/NewMembersGettingStarted]here on Google Code.[/url]

[color="#FF8C00"][size="4"][b]Special Thanks:[/b][/size][/color]

{{Trail|File Formats|Mod File Format}}
SHOU records contain information on dragon shouts and other similar abilities such as racial activated powers.

Each SHOU record always ends with 3 SNAM records for each word of power ([[Tes5Mod:Mod_File_Format/WOOP|WOOP]]) and corresponding ([[Tes5Mod:Mod_File_Format/SPEL|SPEL]]) attached.  Power that are not actual dragon shouts (werewolf, racial) still have the 3 records, they are just all 0s when it doesn't apply.

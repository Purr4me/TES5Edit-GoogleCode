# MWRandItem Uniques Data File - May 2003
#		Dave Humphrey, uesp@sympatico.ca 
#
# The file contains all the unique definitions used for the creation
# of random items. The format is as follows.
#
# Comments		- Anything after the '#' character on a line is ignored.
# Strings		- Values on the right side of the '=' can be surrounded with double
#				  quote characters ("") if desired.#
# 'Unique'		- Start an unique record.
# 'Name'		- The unique item name/suffix/prefix, depending on the name type. 
# 'NameType'	- The type of name generation.
#						Suffix	= Name is added to the base item name as a suffix.
#						Prefix	= Name is added to the base item name as a prefix.
#						Exact	= Name is copied exactly, base item name is not used (default).
# 'ItemLevel'	- The item level of the unique (1 to 100). Higher level uniques will be
#				  rarer and only encountered by high level players.
# 'ItemMask'	- Indicates which item types the effect is valid for. Can be a combination
#				  of the following characters:
#						W = Weapon
#						A = Armor
#						C = Clothing
#						* = All
#					ex: WA  = Weapons and armor
#						WCA = Weapons, armor, and clothing
# 'Effect'		- Each unique item can have up to 6 different effects. These effects are
#				  the name of an existing prefix or suffix effect as defined in the effects
#				  data file. Only the first 8 enchantments from the effects are added to
#				  the item (if it has that many).
# 'End'			- End an unique record.
